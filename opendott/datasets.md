# Datasets

## ESR4 Smart Cities

*2020*

**Description:**

>Felipe Schmidt Fonseca’s research around smart cities has placed a strong emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as ownership and sovereignty. It has placed particular attention on waste management, but with the goal of contributing solutions to avoid as much as possible, reducing the need for waste management in the usual way. Instead, his work aims to encourage the reuse of materials in cities and towns through initiatives of repair and repurposing - aimed at and run by local actors.

>In order to better understand the field, two studies were carried out in the first year:

>- Repair Journey: seven participants were invited to try to repair or repurpose broken objects and were interviewed at the end to discuss what were their challenges and discoveries along the way.
>- Ecosystem Mapping: five people whose work is related to the reuse or re-circulation of second-hand goods were interviewed to compose an overview of the field.

>This dataset contains:

>- Data collected through both studies, consisting of interview transcripts, contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.

The dataset is available via the DOI [10.25398/rd.northumbria.13143179.v1](https://doi.org/10.25398/rd.northumbria.13143179.v1)

## Deployment Datasets

*2021*

**Description:**

>This folder contains data generated during the second year of PhD research on Smart Cities within the OpenDoTT project (Open Design of Trusted Things). OpenDoTT (https://opendott.org) is a PhD programme from Northumbria University and the Mozilla Foundation funded by the European Union / Horizon 2020 / Marie Skłodowska-Curie programme.

> - Researcher: Felipe Schmidt Fonseca ("ESR 4")
> - Research Topic: Smart Cities
> - Primary Supervisor:
>   - Dr Nick Taylor (until October 2021)
>   - Dr Nick Spencer (since November 2021)
> - Secondary Supervisor: Professor Mel Woods
> - Industry Supervisors:
>   - Solana Larsen
>   - Brandi Geurkink

>This PhD research focuses on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, in the forms of repair, upcycling and re-circulation. It investigates the confluence of initiatives and policies in themes such as zero waste, social innovation, circular economy and the doughnut economy.

>The dataset on this folder comprises of data collected through studies and activities, in the shape of interview transcriptions (in formats PDF and ODF), contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.

>The dataset has the following subfolders:

> - "reuse.city": outputs and processual documentation of the online co-design lab conducted with a group of participants involved with initiatives of repair, upcycling and re-circulation of goods and materials.
> - "open_research_log": research journal kept as meta-documentation about this year's activities.
> - "generous_city": ongoing collection of images to be used in a future ethnographic account on the reuse of materials in Berlin.
> - "link-collection": current version of an ongoing collection of bookmarks related to the research themes.

> Note: all but one of the participants who signed up to join the "tech for reuse" research study agreed in the consent form to have their identities potentially identifiable, and contributions attributed to them in the audio transcriptions. For this reasons, the occasional mention to those participants' names were not anonymised from the transcription files. The remaining participant had their name removed from transcriptions.

The dataset is available in Northumbria University's [repository](https://figshare.northumbria.ac.uk/articles/dataset/OpenDoTT_Deployment_Dataset_ESR4_Smart_Cities/17842370)
