## ESR4 Smart Cities

Felipe Schmidt Fonsecaâ€™s research around smart cities has placed a strong emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as ownership and sovereignty. It has placed particular attention on waste management, but with the goal of contributing solutions to avoid as much as possible, reducing the need for waste management in the usual way. Instead, his work aims to encourage the reuse of materials in cities and towns through initiatives of repair and repurposing - aimed at and run by local actors.

In order to better understand the field, two studies were carried out in the first year:

- Repair Journey: seven participants were invited to try to repair or repurpose broken objects and were interviewed at the end to discuss what were their challenges and discoveries along the way.
- Ecosystem Mapping: five people whose work is related to the reuse or re-circulation of second-hand goods were interviewed to compose an overview of the field.

This dataset contains:

- Data collected through both studies, consisting of interview transcripts, contents of emails sent to participants, as well as particular images of activities, notes and analyses.
