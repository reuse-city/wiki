# Research Questions

*(filed under [Thesis](/opendott/thesis))*.

As is probably always the case - particularly in social sciences, art and design -, the exact framing and phrasing of my Research Questions was subject to ongoing challenge and reformulation throughout the PhD. The final version that made it to the [thes](/opendott/thesis) is the following:


> Situating my investigation at the confluence of inclusive urbanism, open-source
technologies and methods, eco-social innovation and service design, I defined my
Research Question (RQ) in the following terms:
‘How can practices of reuse contribute to reimagining and reshaping the way cities handle
excess materials – from industry-oriented waste management to community-based
practices of local waste prevention?’
The RQ unfolds and can be explored through a series of complementary approaches:
> 1. Who are the potential stakeholders of community-based waste prevention,
how is their behaviour, and how do they interact with each other and with
other entities?
> 2. What skills, methods, techniques, information, and technology can help
increase the proportion of materials currently being reused in cities and
regions?
> 3. How to expand practices of reuse in cities through policy-making and
cooperative- and commons-based systems?

My [methodology](/opendott/thesis/methodology) then involved diverse studies and approaches to respond to and expand on the RQ above.
