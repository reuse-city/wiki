## 4. Plans for Year 3

In the OpenDoTT supervisory board meeting that took place in the second semester of 2021, we were informed that completion of project deliverables by the end of June takes priority over PhD writing. Aligning with OpenDoTT plans for the final year, I have already attended three training modules (Digital Inclusion and Digital Literacy; Media Training; Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship) and will need to write reflective pieces about them.

In January we will have a training module on Policy and Advocacy, which will require other particular deliverables:

 - A reflective report on policy implications of concept ideas and prototypes developed in earlier phases;
 - A slide deck with the third iteration of co-designed concepts.
 - A policy workbook.

The exact form of such deliverables is not clear to me at the moment, as the training has not yet started. I will discuss with my supervisors as it unfolds. If any participatory study becomes part of the plan, I will make sure to submit it to ethics approval as usual per Northumbria processes.

I expect to focus on these activities for the first quarter of 2022 or so, then start working on project deliverables. I will be dovetailing my project activities together with the development of my thesis, but will only be able to focus exclusively on the thesis after June.
