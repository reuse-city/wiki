# Reuse Datasets

Reuse Datasets are a research design concept of digital platforms to integrate and provide access to data about different kinds of reuse of materials in urban environments, including household, community and local initiatives. Its main objective is to fill the gap between the recommendation of prioritising reuse over recycling and the lack of reliable data on reuse.
