# Universal Registry of Things

The Universal Registry of Things is a design concept of a trusted source of information about how to reuse objects and materials. It does so by offering information about repair, customisation and repurposing of virtually any kind of thing.

The prototype of the Universal Registry of Things was prototyped for research purposes using the name [ThingWiki](/opendott/prototypes/thingwiki).
