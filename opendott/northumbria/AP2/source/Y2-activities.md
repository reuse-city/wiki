## 2. Activities developed on Year 2

### 2.1. Training

The OpenDoTT consortium offered a series of training modules during the second year, all of which I participated in:

 - Internet Health and Open Leadership, provided by the Mozilla Foundation.
 - Open Hardware and Prototyping, provided by Officine Innesto.
 - Privacy by Design, provided by STBY and UdK.
 - Protecting Intellectual Property, provided by Northumbria University.
 - Media Training, provided by Northumbria University.

I have also attended additional courses, as listed below:

 - Foundations of Doughnut Economics with Kate Raworth, online self-taught course by Ubiquity University.
 - Introduction to the metal workshop (MIG Welding), at Motionlab Berlin.

### 2.2. Research study: reuse.city

To better understand the skills and abilities needed for reusing materials, in order to assess the potential value of materials and how to realise it, I designed a research study be conducted during the second year. I would engage with practitioners experienced with community-based initiatives of reuse - through repair, upcycling or redistribution.

The research questions of the study - originally called thech for reuse but eventually renamed as reuse.city - revolved around the possibility of augmenting and/or replicating value-assessing skills through digital systems - both in software and hardware. In addition, and harkening back to the context of smart (wise?) cities, I wanted to investigate what kind of facility could improve the proportion of materials reused in cities and regions.

The research study recruited participants to join an online co-design lab lasting about a month. Participants were involved in deciding the form and purpose of the co-design lab since the onset. Starting from deciding how to communicate, to what the activities would be and how to adapt to diverse timezones.

A description of the activities conducted during the lab is being formatted as a paper draft. It can be found as an attachment to this report.

### 2.3. Prototyping

In aligment with the purposes of OpenDoTT, during the second year I have co-designed updated concept ideas with participants of reuse.city, and used those concepts as the groundwork for three prototypes:

- E-I is a combination of speculative technologies (hardware and software) to help identify and reuse discarded or idle goods and materials. It can be seen as a digital assistent to repair and reuse of objects.
- ThingWiki is experimental implementation of the earlier concept called Universal Registry of Things. It took the form of a website with information about different object samples. Its data is public and machine-readable.
- Transformation Labs is a blueprint for public spaces akin to maker spaces, but with a strong emphasis on reuse instead of the usual prototyping of new products, or digital fabrication per se.

### 2.4. Events and public engagement

I have attended conferences and events, and had the opportunity to present my research in some occasions:

- As a speaker / presenter / workshop lead:
  - Mozfest - workshop "Universal Registry of Things".
  - Living Knowledge Festival - research presentation.
  - IOT Hotspot Conference - presentation.
  - Encontros do LAB404 - lecture.
  - Tales of Care and Repair - workshops with Brazilian audience; presentation. at the international closing seminar.
  - Open Design in Context - seminar to Northumbria undergrad students.
- As audience / participant:
  - Pivot Conference.
  - 4S Annual Meeting.
  - Creative Bureaucracy Festival.
  - Subvercity.
  - FAB CITY Summit.

Tales of Care and Repair was a particularly interesting development. It was led by a professor of the University of West England as a Creative Commission by the British Council exploring climate change leading to COP-26, the climate conference hosted in Glasgow. I was initially invited by a former colleague to advise on organising the Brazilian seminar and workshops connected to the project. Eventually the project lead invited me to join the international closing seminar as well.  

### 2.5. Secondment - Berlin

As mentioned earlier on this report, experiencing Berlin from the street level helped construct my reflection on "generous cities". It also allowed me to engage with local actors related to my research topic, work for some months at a local makerspace and attend in-person events. Some examples are listed below:

- Motionlab - makerspace and co-working with a vibrant start-up scene.
- HdM - place that hosts organisations working with material recovery and upcycling.
- Circular Berlin network and the Circular Futures Festival.
- Zero Waste Berlin and the Zero Waste Berlin Festival.
- Events:
  - Transmediale Festival and Symposium.
  - Climate Care Conference.
