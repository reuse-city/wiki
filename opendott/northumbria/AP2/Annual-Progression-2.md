# Annual Progression Report - Year 2

Felipe Schmidt Fonseca
ESR 4 - OpenDoTT

## 1. OpenDoTT, year 2 in context

My PhD research is part of OpenDoTT, an international doctoral training program designed around three distinct stages, each one lasting approximately one year. On the first year, still based in the UK, we - the five OpenDoTT fellows - would explore Research Through Design and conduct studies to help define and refine our initial research questions. The second year should start with our relocation to Berlin, working at the Mozilla Foundation. The emphasis at that point would change to Open Design and Internet Health, accompanied by focal training modules on prototyping with Open Hardware and Privacy by Design. Finally, the third year would be about Digital Inclusion, Policy and Legislation, as well as securing time to write, submit and present our theses. We have so far completed the activities planned for the second year of the project.

It is not uncommon for planned projects to change over the course of events, but the state of the world - as well as the very nature of OpenDoTT, with an international and diverse cohort and a phase of secondment abroad - seemed to require even more flexibility. The whole project moved from Dundee to Northumbria, faced COVID restrictions and the effects of Brexit (both having an impact on the situation with visas and consequently the group's ability to move to Berlin), along with other internal issues and personal dynamics. On top of that, significant changes occurred in supervisory teams and project management. It has been an impermanent scenario, to say the least.

### 1.1. From AP1 onwards

The contextualisation above is by no means presented as an excuse. Rather, it is here only as an observation that between writing my first Annual Progression report - somewhere around October 2020 - and having the AP panel meeting in January 2021, I had already attended a couple of activities programmed for the second year. Other circumstancial conditions were also in place and may have influenced my state during the panel meeting: the flight that would bring me and my family back from holidays in Brazil was cancelled and I was spending some weeks in the mountains surrounded by atlantic rainforest, in close connection with my roots.

The first signficant outcome I took away from AP1 was the recommendation to be more specific about methodology. That question was already present in the meetings with my supervisors. Until the moment I was asked about that in the AP panel meeting however, I had not realised how influenced I had been by my former MA supervisor at the University of Campinas. He is a social scientist, with a Masters in Linguistics and a PhD in social anthropology. The AP panel was triggered the realisation that my way of researching borrows significantly from Anthropology, even though I don't consider my work as affiliated directly to that field of expertise.  It should also be fair to say that the Internet Health training a couple of months earlier was a crucial point, as will be described in the section "Storylines" below.

Throughout the second year I was then constantly facing the question of how to describe my methodological approach and reconcile it with my background and past projects. To mention one among many authors, Tim Ingold proposes that ethnography is a study _of_ the world with a documentary purpose, whilst anthropology studies _with_ the world and effects transformations onto it [^ingold]. I tend to aligh with the latter, based on my previous experience both in academia as well as in social and activist initiatives. In other words, I wouldn't want to detach from my research subject as an external, unbiased observer.

That position seems to suggest a remarkable diversion on my research from the way ethnography and other participatory methods are often portrayed within the field of design. Already apologising for the cartoonish depiction, I do not arrive at this point as a trained industrial designer willing to learn from users what their opinion or impression is on whatever I am creating. Quite the contrary, in a sense. I am informed by almost two decades of experience as a social activist from the global south who is used to building, engaging with and being part of communities. At times during that path I have also been a researcher, a teacher or trainer, a consultant to public and private institutions, a member of a technology startup, a social entrepreneur, a representative of the cultural sector in an advisory board for public policies. Whatever contribution I may offer to scholarship about design, technology and cities (smart or otherwise) would arguably benefit from relating to those experiences.

### 1.2. Methodology

Keeping documentation of activities, reflections and ideas has always been part of my way of engaging with the world. I do that through a myriad of means: digital notes, audio recordings and pictures made on my smartphone, presentation slides, physical journals taken everywhere, collaborative boards, even the occasional video. Already in the first months of the project in 2019 I have set up a research blog as a section of my personal website. During the second year I started using git repositories - online archives with version control - to archive notes as well as to engage with participants of the research study I conducted. And more recently I started using wikis - hypertextual and easily editable websites - to organise my documentation.

It would be a stretch too far to propose that all of those materials could be formatted as anything akin to a diary study, precisely because they are that extensive and loose-ended. But re-engaging with my repositores when working on project deliverables recently suggested there is potential there. About that same time I was appointed my new primary supervisor, who suggested I had a look at constructivist grounded theory (CGT). I later found that one of my industry supervisors had already pointed me in that direction, but I had not yet given proper attention to it. I am still early into it - learning more about Kathy Charmaz and her work [^Charmaz]. It seems to provide a consistent way to go through qualitative research data - including researchers' notes and reflections as well as data collected from participants - and strike a balance between participatory activities and theory-building. At the moment I expect to explore that path further in the near future in order to structure my research.

### 1.3. Storylines

The second valuable contribution I had from the first AP meeting was a recommendation to work on the story underlying my research. This suggestion unfolded into developments eventually incorporated on my research over the second year. I kept working on literature and references that helped me both explore and situate different strands of work. On the other hand, I started working on two proto-concepts:

 - open design shaped as an open-ended spiral instead of a circle;
 - generous cities as a concept to address issues present in contemporary cities such as social inequality, waste of resources and climate change.

Each of them has potential for development, under distinct framings, briefly described below.

#### 1.3.1. Spiral of Openness

The Internet Health and Open Leadership training gave me the opportunity to re-engage with literature and references about open source and technology-inspired collaborative practices. Besides being already familiar - for more than a decade - with canonical authors on the universe of open source ([^lessig], [^raymond], [^benkler]), many of my past projects were also influenced by critical takes on the same topics ([^shadeofthecommons], [^notworking]). In particular, one action-research project I was part of explored how the concept of commons could relate to open collaborative science [^opensciencesocialchange].

In re-examining those references and projects under the contemporary zeitgeist - marked by growing awareness of issues such as coloniality, environmental impact, among others - I found some problematic issues. In particular a noted bias on the common understanding of what openness means. A good way to express that was drawing on an image described [^germano] by Germano Bruno Afonso, a professor who studied ethnoastronomy in native Brazilian peoples: the spiral. Rather than depicting a cyclic process shaped like a circle as seen by observers, the spiral positions the observers inside the process. At every turn, the observers looks back and realise they are themselves transformed as much as the world. I assembled this and other insights stemming from the training, and published them as a blogpost [^spiralblog]. I expect to deepen and refine further this concept on my thesis.

#### 1.3.2. Generous Cities

At start of the second year my research path seemed to be diverting too much from my original research topic at OpenDoTT, that of "smart cities". One should obviously consider, as I mentioned at my first AP panel session, that the advert for the program already allowed some cricitism of the field:

> Technology is fundamentally changing how cities work, but these smart cities are most often determined in a top-down fashion, with little transparency or accountability in how data influences the workings of the city. Can we create cities that are **not just smarter, but kinder, fairer and more citizen-centred**?

Throughout my first year I was indeed seeking participatory, grassroots, transparent - as well as  kinder and fairer - possibilities. One of my industry supervisors noted that the term "citizen" is loaded with political issues, so I'm trying to avoid the term "citizen-centred" but remain none the less interested in bringing about concrete benefits to local populations. To that effect, I had already proposed a turn from "waste management" into "waste prevention" as a way to escape noted biases of the mainstream narrative around smart cities. During the second year, both by engaging with participants of my research study (described later in this report) as well as by being myself located in Berlin, yet another update was due. It can be summarised in two paragraphs I wrote recenlty for one of the project deliverables:

> Every city manifests itself in multiple layers of flows and containments, commonalities and separation, collaboration and conflict. They are not static in time. In truth they are subject to dynamics of power, culture, global trends, environmental conditions, among other variables. Here again it might be unwise to claim that some cities are adopting “smart” strategies, unlike the others which remain… what? Dumb? Stupid?
> Going further on the metaphor, in fact, may provide some elements to discussion. Do we want our cities to be only smart? Shouldn’t we be aiming higher? How about intelligent cities? Or wise cities that beyond seeking only the immediate optimisation of their systems can envision ways for their population to thrive for centuries. Cities of conviviality, of shared abundance. Cities that can heal social division, whilst creating beauty and meaning.

Experimenting on my own project the concept of open spiral hinted at in the previous section of this report, I set myself to engage with the world - participants of my research study, supervisors, colleagues, literature, conference speakers - and later return to reflect. I started the year situating my work as being about "waste prevention in smart cities". Over the months I found the term "reuse.city". It became the name of a collaborative research study, and I considered using it as a title for the thesis. On the ohter hand, my impression of how common it is to find functional objects on the sidewalks of Berlin, as well as in online communities for material re-circulation and in second-hand shops, suggested I should have my eyes on that. I spent some time thinking about excess, abundance and generosity.

It was after a presentation that a comment by a person in the audience made me reflect on how "abundance" can be seen as passive, a simple and often wasteful result of excess. Whilst on the other hand "generosity" could be interpreted in this context as an act of care, a response to excess as well as an attempt to overcome scarcity. Based on that understanding, generosity could take center stage of my research and orient everything else I am doing. Thus my current focus on "generous cities" as a concept - still to be further developed - competing with smart cities as the overall framing of my work on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, repair, upcycling and recirculation.

## 2. Activities developed on Year 2

### 2.1. Training

The OpenDoTT consortium offered a series of training modules during the second year, all of which I participated in:

 - Internet Health and Open Leadership, provided by the Mozilla Foundation.
 - Open Hardware and Prototyping, provided by Officine Innesto.
 - Privacy by Design, provided by STBY and UdK.
 - Protecting Intellectual Property, provided by Northumbria University.
 - Media Training, provided by Northumbria University.

I have also attended additional courses, as listed below:

 - Foundations of Doughnut Economics with Kate Raworth, online self-taught course by Ubiquity University.
 - Introduction to the metal workshop (MIG Welding), at Motionlab Berlin.

### 2.2. Research study: reuse.city

To better understand the skills and abilities needed for reusing materials, in order to assess the potential value of materials and how to realise it, I designed a research study be conducted during the second year. I would engage with practitioners experienced with community-based initiatives of reuse - through repair, upcycling or redistribution.

The research questions of the study - originally called thech for reuse but eventually renamed as reuse.city - revolved around the possibility of augmenting and/or replicating value-assessing skills through digital systems - both in software and hardware. In addition, and harkening back to the context of smart (wise?) cities, I wanted to investigate what kind of facility could improve the proportion of materials reused in cities and regions.

The research study recruited participants to join an online co-design lab lasting about a month. Participants were involved in deciding the form and purpose of the co-design lab since the onset. Starting from deciding how to communicate, to what the activities would be and how to adapt to diverse timezones.

A description of the activities conducted during the lab is being formatted as a paper draft. It can be found as an attachment to this report.

### 2.3. Prototyping

In aligment with the purposes of OpenDoTT, during the second year I have co-designed updated concept ideas with participants of reuse.city, and used those concepts as the groundwork for three prototypes:

- E-I is a combination of speculative technologies (hardware and software) to help identify and reuse discarded or idle goods and materials. It can be seen as a digital assistent to repair and reuse of objects.
- ThingWiki is experimental implementation of the earlier concept called Universal Registry of Things. It took the form of a website with information about different object samples. Its data is public and machine-readable.
- Transformation Labs is a blueprint for public spaces akin to maker spaces, but with a strong emphasis on reuse instead of the usual prototyping of new products, or digital fabrication per se.

### 2.4. Events and public engagement

I have attended conferences and events, and had the opportunity to present my research in some occasions:

- As a speaker / presenter / workshop lead:
  - Mozfest - workshop "Universal Registry of Things".
  - Living Knowledge Festival - research presentation.
  - IOT Hotspot Conference - presentation.
  - Encontros do LAB404 - lecture.
  - Tales of Care and Repair - workshops with Brazilian audience; presentation. at the international closing seminar.
  - Open Design in Context - seminar to Northumbria undergrad students.
- As audience / participant:
  - Pivot Conference.
  - 4S Annual Meeting.
  - Creative Bureaucracy Festival.
  - Subvercity.
  - FAB CITY Summit.

Tales of Care and Repair was a particularly interesting development. It was led by a professor of the University of West England as a Creative Commission by the British Council exploring climate change leading to COP-26, the climate conference hosted in Glasgow. I was initially invited by a former colleague to advise on organising the Brazilian seminar and workshops connected to the project. Eventually the project lead invited me to join the international closing seminar as well.  

### 2.5. Secondment - Berlin

As mentioned earlier on this report, experiencing Berlin from the street level helped construct my reflection on "generous cities". It also allowed me to engage with local actors related to my research topic, work for some months at a local makerspace and attend in-person events. Some examples are listed below:

- Motionlab - makerspace and co-working with a vibrant start-up scene.
- HdM - place that hosts organisations working with material recovery and upcycling.
- Circular Berlin network and the Circular Futures Festival.
- Zero Waste Berlin and the Zero Waste Berlin Festival.
- Events:
  - Transmediale Festival and Symposium.
  - Climate Care Conference.

## 3. Thesis Development

Towards the end of the year I had a workshop looking into the thesis structure with my four supervisors. That helped structure an outline for my thesis that can be found in the [attachment](AP2-thesis.structure.md).

## 4. Plans for Year 3

In the OpenDoTT supervisory board meeting that took place in the second semester of 2021, we were informed that completion of project deliverables by the end of June takes priority over PhD writing. Aligning with OpenDoTT plans for the final year, I have already attended three training modules (Digital Inclusion and Digital Literacy; Media Training; Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship) and will need to write reflective pieces about them.

In January we will have a training module on Policy and Advocacy, which will require other particular deliverables:

 - A reflective report on policy implications of concept ideas and prototypes developed in earlier phases;
 - A slide deck with the third iteration of co-designed concepts.
 - A policy workbook.

The exact form of such deliverables is not clear to me at the moment, as the training has not yet started. I will discuss with my supervisors as it unfolds. If any participatory study becomes part of the plan, I will make sure to submit it to ethics approval as usual per Northumbria processes.

I expect to focus on these activities for the first quarter of 2022 or so, then start working on project deliverables. I will be dovetailing my project activities together with the development of my thesis, but will only be able to focus exclusively on the thesis after June.
