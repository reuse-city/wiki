## Feedback

> I approve your annual progression, but there are a few things that are really important for you to work on as soon as possible: primarily your theoretical and methodological grounding of the work. I think it will be important for you to find the literature you want to speak with in your dissertation, which will ultimately shape your ontology, epistemology, and subsequent methodology - and importantly whether or not you are building on anticolonial theories and notions for your dissertation as this will likely have a big impact on the ways in which you interpret knowing, data, and so on. From experience, I would argue that with having that figured out, things like your dissertation structure and the methods you use will become much more clear. I am a little bit worried you do not have this theoretical aspect figured out yet, but it is absolutely understandable given the amount of work you are doing in the OpenDoTT project. Overall, I think you have a really interesting project, that depending on which way you choose to go has some exciting potential for shaping how we think about design and sustainability critically. and the projects you have worked on are exciting avenues of inquiry - figuring out how to tell that story is difficult. But I am a firm believer in the notion that the writing process is part of the thinking process, so I would encourage you to try to write out some text (doesn't have to be structured in any way) on what argument you are wanting to make with your dissertation. You explained this really well in the panel meeting, so please write this down. then you have something to work with and build on rather than feeling like starting from a blank page. use the writing you have done so far in your blogposts to your advantage as well, and start to bring together your thinking. Well done, and I'm excited to see the progress you will have made in the AP3!"
