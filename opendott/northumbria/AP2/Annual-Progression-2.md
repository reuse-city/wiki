# Annual Progression 2

**Note on 03.01.2021:** This is still a very early draft. It will be improved during until the submission date on 07.01.2022.

## 1. OpenDoTT, year 2 in context

The OpenDoTT project, of which my PhD research is part of, was designed around three distinct stages, each one lasting approximately one year. On the first year, still in the UK, we - the five OpenDoTT fellows - would explore Research Through Design and conduct studies to help define and refine our initial research questions. The second year should start with our relocation to Berlin, working at the Mozilla Foundation. The emphasis at that point would change to Open Design and Internet Health, accompanied by focal training modules on prototyping with Open Hardware and Privacy by Design. Finally, the third year would be about Digital Inclusion, Policy and Legislation, as well as securing time to write, submit and present our theses.

It is not uncommon for PhD plans to change over the course of events, but the state of the world - as well as the very nature of OpenDoTT, a project with an international and diverse cohort and a secondment phase abroad - seemed to require even more flexibility. The whole project moved from Dundee to Northumbria, faced COVID restrictions and the effects of Brexit (both having an impact on the situation with Visas and consequently the group's ability to move to Berlin), along with other internal issues and personal dynamics, and on top of that significant changes occurred in supervisory teams and project management. It has been an impermanent scenario, to say the least.

### 1.1. From AP1 onwards

The contextualisation above is by no means presented as an excuse. Rather, it is here only as an observation that between writing my first Annual Progression report - somewhere around October 2020 - and having the AP panel meeting in January 2021, I had already attended a couple of initial activities originally programmed for the second year. Other circumstancial conditions were also in place and may have influenced my presence at the panel meeting: the flight that would bring me and my family back from holidays in Brazil was cancelled and I was spending some weeks in the mountains surrounded by atlantic rainforest, in close connection with my roots.

The first signficant outcome I personally took away from AP1 came when the examiner suggested me I should be more specific about methodology. In truthness, that question was already present earlier during my supervisory meetings. Until that moment, however, I had not realised how influenced I had been by my Master's supervisor at the University of Campinas. He is a social scientist, with a Masters in Linguistics and a PhD in social anthropology. The examiner's note was the trigger to the realisation that my way of researching borrows significantly from Anthropology, even though I don't consider my work as affiliated directly to that field of expertise.  It should also be fair to say that the Internet Health training a couple of months earlier was a crucial point, as will be described in the section "Storyline" below.

Throughout the second year I was then constantly facing the question of how to describe my methodological approach and reconcile it with my own background and past projects. To mention one among many authors, Tim Ingold proposes that ethnography is a study _of_ the world with a documentary purpose, whilst anthropology studies _with_ the world and effects transformations onto it [^ingold]. I tend to aligh with the latter, based on my own previous experience both in academia as well as in social and activist initiatives. In other words, I wouldn't want to detach from my research subject as an external, unbiased observer.

That position seems to suggest a remarkable diversion on my research from the way ethnography and other participatory methods are often portrayed within the field of design. Already apologising for the cartoonish depiction, I do not arrive at this point as a trained industrial designer willing to learn from users what is their opinion or impression on whatever it is that I am creating. Quite the contrary, in a sense. I am informed by almost two decades of experience as a social activist from the global south who is used to building, engaging with and being part of communities. At times during that path I have been also a researcher, a teacher or trainer, a consultant to public and private institutions, a member of a technology startup, a social entrepreneur, a representative of the cultural sector in an advisory board for public policies. Whatever contribution I may offer to scholarship about design, technology and cities (smart or otherwise) would arguably benefit from relating to those experiences.

### 1.2. Methodology

Keeping documentation of activities, reflections and ideas has always been part of my way of engaging with the world. I do that through a myriad of means: digital notes, audio recordings and pictures made on my smartphone, presentation slides, physical journals taken everywhere, collaborative boards, even the occasional videos. Already in the first months of the project in 2019 I have set up a research blog as a section of my personal website. During the second year I started using git repositories both to archive notes as well as to engage with participants of a research study. And more recently I started using wikis - hypertextual and easily editable websites - to organise my documentation.

It would be a stretch too far to propose that all of those materials could be formatted as anything akin to a diary study, precisely because they are that extensive and loose-ended. But re-engaging with my repositores recently when working on project deliverables suggested there is potential there. About that same time I was appointed my new primary supervisor, who suggested I had a look at *constructivist grounded theory*. I later found that one of my industry supervisors had already pointed me in that direction, but I had not yet given proper attention to it. I am still early into it - learning more about Kathy Charmaz and her work [^Charmaz]. It seems to provide a consistent way to go through qualitative research data - including researchers' notes and reflections as well as data collected from participants - and strike a balance between participatory activities and theory-building. At the moment I expect to explore that path further in the near future in order to structure my research.

### 1.3. Storylines

The second valuable contribution I had from the first AP meeting was a recommendation to work on a coherent story underlying my research. This point unfolded into developments eventually incorporated on my research over the second year. I kept working on literature and references that helped me both explore and situate different strands of work. On the other hand, I started working on two proto-concepts:

 - open design taking the shape of an open-ended spiral instead of a circle;
 - generous cities as a concept to address issues manifested in contemporary cities such as social inequality, waste of resources and climate change.

Each of them seems to have potential for development, under distinct framings. Below is a summary of them.

#### 1.3.1. Spiral of Openness

The Internet Health and Open Leadership training gave me the opportunity to re-engage with literature and references about open source and technology-inspired collaborative practices. Besides being already familiar - for more than a decade - with canonical authors on the universe of open source ([^lessig], [^raymond], [^benkler]), many of my past projects were also influenced by critical takes on the same topics ([^shadeofthecommons], [^notworking]). In particular, one action-research project I was part of explored how the concept of commons could relate to open collaborative science [^opensciencesocialchange].

In re-examining those references and projects under the contemporary zeitgeist - marked by growing awareness of issues such as coloniality, environmental impact, among others - I found some problematic issues. In particular a perceived bias on the common understanding of what openness means. To me a good way to express it was drawing on an image described [^germano] by Germano Bruno Afonso, a professor who studied ethnoastronomy in native Brazilian peoples: the spiral. Rather than depicting a cyclic process shaped as a circle as seen by observerers, the spiral positions the observers inside the process. At every turn, the observers looks back and realises they are transformed themselves. I assembled this and other insights of the training and published them as a blogpost [^spiralblog]. I expect to deepen and refine further this concept on my thesis.

#### 1.3.2. Generous Cities

At start of the second year my research path seemed to be diverting too much from my original research topic at OpenDoTT, that of "smart cities". One should obviously consider, as I mentioned at my first AP panel session, that the advert for the program already allowed some cricitism of the field:

> Technology is fundamentally changing how cities work, but these smart cities are most often determined in a top-down fashion, with little transparency or accountability in how data influences the workings of the city. Can we create cities that are **not just smarter, but kinder, fairer and more citizen-centred**?

Throughout my first year I was indeed seeking kinder and fairer possibilities, trying to bring about concrete benefits to local populations (one of my industry supervisors made me notice that the term "citizen" is loaded with political issues, so I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible). I had already proposed a turn from "waste management" into "waste prevention" as a way to escape noted biases of the mainstream narrative around smart cities. During the second year, both by engaging with participants of my research study (described later in this report) as well as by being myself located in Berlin, another aggiornamento was due. As I wrote for one of the project deliverables recently:

> Every city manifests itself in multiple layers of flows and containments, commonalities and separation, collaboration and conflict. They are not static in time. In truth they are subject to dynamics of power, culture, global trends, environmental conditions, among other variables. Here again it might be unwise to claim that some cities are adopting “smart” strategies, unlike the others which remain… what? Dumb? Stupid?
> Going further on the metaphor, in fact, may provide some elements to discussion. Do we want our cities to be only smart? Shouldn’t we be aiming higher? How about intelligent cities? Or wise cities that beyond seeking only the immediate optimisation of their systems can envision ways for their population to thrive for centuries. Cities of conviviality, of shared abundance. Cities that can heal social division, whilst creating beauty and meaning.

Experimenting on my own project the concept of open spiral, I would engage with the world - participants of my study, supervisors, colleagues, literature, conference speakers - and later return to my reflections. If I started by presenting my research as being about "waste prevention in smart cities", over time I played with the term "reuse.city" as a potential title for the thesis. That eventually became the name of a collaborative research study, and I kept exploring ideas. My impression of how common it is to find functional objects on the sidewalks of Berlin, as well as in online communities for material re-circulation and in second-hand shops, suggested I should have my eyes on it. I spent some months thinking about excess, abundance and generosity.

It was after my presentation at a seminar that a comment by a person in the audience made me reflect on how "abundance" can be seen as passive, a simple and often wasteful result of excess. Whilst "generosity" would emerge in this context as an act of care, a response to excess as well as an attempt to overcome scarcity. Based on that understanding, generosity could take center stage of my research and orient everything else I am doing. Thus my current focus on "generous cities" as a concept still to be developed, competing with smart cities as the overall framing of my work on waste prevention through collective practices of reuse, repair, upcycling and recirculation.

### 2.2. Research study: reuse.city

DESCRIPTION OF reuse.city, participants, outcomes

(PASTED FROM WP2 DELIVERABLE)

In the second year of research I set out to learn more about the skills and abilities needed for reusing things. This is central if we want to enable society to increase the proportion of materials diverted from the waste stream to promote social and environmental gains. By understanding the potential value of materials and how to realise it, a turn from excess into material generosity will be possible.

With that objective in mind, I designed a research study to engage with practitioners experienced with community-based initiatives of reuse - through repair, upcycling or redistribution. The research questions of said study revolved around the possibility of augmenting and/or replicating value-assessing skills through digital systems - both in software and hardware. In addition, and harkening back to the context of smart (wise?) cities, I wanted to investigate what kind of facility could improve the proportion of materials reused in cities and regions.


The research study would recruit participants to join an online co-design lab for about a month, and involve them in decide its form and purpose since the onset. Starting from deciding how to communicate, to what the activities would be and how to adapt to diverse timezones.
