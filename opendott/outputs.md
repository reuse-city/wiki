## Presentations

### Repair Journey (2021)

Presentation during the Living Knowledge 9 Conference.

**Abstract:**

> Design Probes are used in Design Research as means to promote open-ended interaction with participants, whilst keeping focus on a particular theme or issue. Probes are objects intentionally kept incomplete, in order to bring contributions to the fore. Examples of probes commonly deployed in design research studies are disposable cameras, portable diaries and other objects handed to the research subjects for a period of time, and with/through which they are asked to interact.
This presentation will share the results of an experiment done as part of a PhD research on waste avoidance and smart cities. In the experiment, participants were asked to pick an object that was either broken, obsolete or inadequate, and try to make such object usable and/or valuable by any means. For research purposes, those objects were treated as ‘broken probes’ in order to elicit discussions about value, ownership and agency in contemporary society.

## Workbooks

As a way to document ongoing processes, OpenDoTT planned to publish workbooks themed on elements of its research structure. My sections in these workbooks are available in the PDFs below:

- [Design Research Workbook](reports/2020-Design-Research-Workbook.pdf) (2020).
- [Open Technology Workbook](reports/2021-Open-Technology-Workbook.pdf) (2020).
- [Policy Workbook](reports/2022-Policy-Workbook.pdf) (2022).

Additionally, my reports from two training modules were also structured as workbooks:

- [Internet Health](/opendott/reports/2020-Internet-Health.pdf) (2020).
- [Digital Inclusion and Digital Literacy](/opendott/reports/2022-Digital-Inclusion-Literacy-Slides.pdf) (2022).

The project has also composed an overall [Research Skills Workbook](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5f91b1035&appId=PPGMS). And instead of proceedings of a final conference that did not take place, the OpenDoTT consortium published a book titled ["Reboot IoT"](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5fbfeffa7&appId=PPGMS).
