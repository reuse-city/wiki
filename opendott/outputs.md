**Description:**

> The treatment of solid waste is often seen as an engineering problem whose solution is to be entirely outsourced to private corporations that will either recycle stuff (in its industrial meaning – transform them back into raw materials) or dispose of them in landfills or incinerators. However, a significant proportion of the typical municipal waste could be reused and repurposed before such final and environmentally intensive measures. 
The purpose of this session is to discuss what sort of policies, infrastructure and governance schemes could help society reuse more of the materials it currently discards.
Researcher Felipe Schmidt Fonseca starts with his experiences in Brazil in computer reuse, but takes us on a critical journey through concepts of the "smart city" and "internet of things".
