As a way to document ongoing processes, OpenDoTT planned to publish workbooks themed around its research structure. My sections in these workbooks are available in the PDFs below:

- Research Workbook (to be added).
- [Open Technology Workbook](reports/2021-Open-Technology-Workbook.pdf) (2021).
- [Policy Workbook](reports/2022-Policy-Workbook.pdf) (2022).

Additionally, reports from two training modules were also structured as workbooks:

- [Internet Health](/opendott/reports/2020-Internet-Health.pdf) (2020).
- [Digital Inclusion and Digital Literacy](/opendott/reports/2022-Digital-Inclusion-Literacy-Slides.pdf) (2022).
