As a way to document ongoing processes, OpenDoTT planned to publish workbooks themed on elements of its research structure. My sections in these workbooks are available in the PDFs below:

- [Design Research Workbook](reports/2020-Design-Research-Workbook.pdf) (2020).
- [Open Technology Workbook](reports/2021-Open-Technology-Workbook.pdf) (2020).
- [Policy Workbook](reports/2022-Policy-Workbook.pdf) (2022).

Additionally, my reports from two training modules were also structured as workbooks:

- [Internet Health](/opendott/reports/2020-Internet-Health.pdf) (2020).
- [Digital Inclusion and Digital Literacy](/opendott/reports/2022-Digital-Inclusion-Literacy-Slides.pdf) (2022).

The project has also composed an overall [Research Skills Workbook](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5f91b1035&appId=PPGMS). And instead of proceedings of a final conference that did not take place, the OpenDoTT consortium published a book titled ["Reboot IoT"](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5fbfeffa7&appId=PPGMS).
