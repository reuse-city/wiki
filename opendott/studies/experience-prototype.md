# Experience prototype

## Research questions



## Objectives

Based on the workshops conducted during the [reuse city lab](/opendott/studies/reuse-city-lab) in April 2021, new co-design concepts based on the original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) were developed. The experience prototype will wrap up the discussions by presenting those concepts in use and gathering feedback from participants.

## Participants

The experience prototype will invite the same participants who signed up the consent form for the [reuse city co-design lab](/opendott/studies/reuse-city-lab). New participants will be able to join as long as they fill the consent form.

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited by social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants. New participants will be invited via social media, as well as interest groups and communities such as Zero Waste Berlin, Motionlab, Zerbas Unite Berlin and Platform Coops Germany.
