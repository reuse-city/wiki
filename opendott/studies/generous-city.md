Generous city is a portrait of the reuse of materials in cities and regions from the perspective of a reflective individual city-dweller. It builds on my personal experience as a foreign citizen interested in understanding cultures of repair, repurposing and re-circulation, as well as systems, infrastructure and incentives to waste prevention that connect with those cultural practices.

On this page and its containing folders I will collect and organise references, inmpressions, experiences and memories. I plan to transform these materials into at least one essay, borrowing instruments from anthropology such as, but not limited to, ethnography.

The original inspiration for this approach can be seen on [this post on my research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/generous-city), while I was still living in Dundee.

## Foreign-ness

In a recent conversation with my PhD supervisors I was made aware that proposing a "citizen" approach to a project could raise objections. I must confess that thus far I had never reflected upon the ambiguity of the term. If on the one hand it can imply an openness to democratic participation of a city's inhabitants (the citizenry, les citoyénnes, la ciudadanía) on decision-making, it can often mean a polar opposite. I'm reminded of the early Greek democracy, of which is said to then only allow the participation of fully abled citizens - thus removing women, slaves and foreigners from the scenario.

It took me a while to realise how much my own experience of being a Brazilian in Europe reflects this ambiguity. On the one hand, I have a work contract with a reputed University, which naturally opens many doors. In addition to that, I am also the father of two bi-national children, Brazilian and German. On the other hand, though, there were many occasions in which I felt less than a fully-abled citizen.
