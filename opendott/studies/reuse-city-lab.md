# reuse.city
## online co-design lab (March-August 2021)

reuse.city is a research study exploring waste prevention in smart cities. In earlier phases of this [PhD research](/opendott), two studies were carried out - [repair journey](/opendott/studies/repair-journey) and [ecosystem mapping](/opendott/studies/ecosystem-mapping) - which respectively identified participants’ behaviours towards broken objects, and how unwanted materials circulate in society before they are discarded. Building on such prior activities, reuse.city explores technologies, methods and behaviour involving the reuse of second hand goods and materials in cities and regions through practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation.

## Objectives

The main goal of this study is to understand to what extent the ability to
reuse goods and materials in cities and regions can be promoted with the aid of networked digital tecnologies. A secondary objective is to investigate social as well as cultural aspects influencing the reuse of goods and materials.

The research objectives will be accomplished by three axes of activities conducted in parallel:

 - engaging with a group of participants in a series of workshops called reuse.city co-design lab
 - building prototypes of technology to help assess the potential value of goods and materials
 - conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the city of Berlin

## Research questions

reuse.city seeks to expand understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with assessing the potential value of discarded materials and realising that value with the aid of digital technologies. It is expected to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the cultural as well as informational elements that impact the ability to assess the potential value of discarded or broken materials?
- RQ2: can the skills involved in the reuse of materials be replicated via digital systems?
- RQ3: ~~what conditions outside of technology and information impact on the ability of cities to reuse a larger proportion of discarded materials?~~

## Participants

The reuse.city co-design lab recruited 29 participants from 10 different countries in four continents which signed up to the study and filled the [consent form](/opendott/studies/reuse-city-lab/ethics).

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants.

## Study methodology

reuse.city approaches the [research questions](#research-questions) from three complementary perspectives:

 - the reuse.city co-design lab was created to present and expand on the original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) developed in the first year of research, by involving [participants](#participants) interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. As it was carried out, it became also an opportunity to start building an international community of stakeholders experienced in activities of reuse and repair.
 - prototyping and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a [training module on open hardware](/opendott/training/open-hardware).
 - an ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, and how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials.

Participatory + community building + open design + open-ended/spiral

In order to expand and disseminate the reuse of materials so as to contribute to prevent the generation of waste, the project seeks to understand what types of data, skills and experience are involved in assessing the potential value of
goods and materials. The main goal is to envision technologies that replicate and expand on the skills of evaluating materials and their potential reuse.

This will be
accomplished by a combination of two concept ideas: a multi‐layered database of objects and materials (“universal registry
of things”); and a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information about their repairability,
spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling. Through online workshops, groups of
participants with diverse levels of involvement with repair, reuse and waste will be exposed to a prototype of such
concept ideas and discuss what their implications might be in real scenarios.

## Activities

The lab took place initially as a series of meetings and online discussions in April 2021. As well as refining the concept ideas and informing their prototyping, the reuse.city co-design lab became also an opportunity to put in practice community-building and open methodologies.

Initially, the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the universal registry of things, had already been refined in a session at Mozfest 2021. The second was based on point-and-reuse, but was articulated in more abstract terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. For discussion purposes, E-I could still be thought of as an app for mobile devices, but in tandem with the open hardware training and expected tech demonstrations, it is being prototyped as a workbench machine with similar functionality.

Through the workshops conducted in April, new co-design concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them are currently being turned into prototypes: ThingWiki (an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things) and E-I (an evaluation interface based on two earlier concept ideas).

The upcoming experience prototype phase will wrap up the discussions by inviting participants to watch a demonstration of E-I and ThingWiki in use. The demonstration will be an audiovisual performance. Participants will then be asked to reply to a structured online questionnaire.


## Analysis

### Main takeaways

(very early impressions of the meetings in april)

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.
