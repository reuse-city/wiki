# reuse.city lab - study design

## Objectives

The reuse.city online co-design lab was created to expand on the original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) developed in the first year of research, by involving participants interested and/or engaged on the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. The lab took place initially as a series of meetings and online discussions in April 2021. It was followed by a period of prototyping. The last phase of the lab will be an experience prototype, with a demonstration of the co-designed ideas in use and subsequent feedback from participants.

## Research questions

The main goal of the reuse city lab is to understand to what extent the ability to assess the potential value of materials relies on a set of skills which could be augmented and replicated with the use of networked digital technologies.

- RQ1: what are the cultural as well as informational elements that impact the ability to assess the potential value of discarded or broken materials?
- RQ2: 

## Participants

Prior to and during the events in April, 29 participants from 10 different countries signed up and filled the consent form. A new round of recruitment will be done before the experience prototype phase.

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited by social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants. New participants will be invited via social media, as well as interest groups and communities such as Zero Waste Berlin, Motionlab, Zerbas Unite Berlin and Platform Coops Germany.
Study methodology

The participants will be sent a link that allows them to watch a video of the prototype in action, and reply to a structured questionnaire.

## Activities

Initially, the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the universal registry of things, had already been refined in a session at Mozfest 2021. The second was based on point-and-reuse, but was articulated in more abstract terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. For discussion purposes, E-I could still be thought of as an app for mobile devices, but in tandem with the open hardware training and expected tech demonstrations, it is being prototyped as a workbench machine with similar functionality.

Through the workshops conducted in April, new co-design concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them are currently being turned into prototypes: ThingWiki (an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things) and E-I (an evaluation interface based on two earlier concept ideas).

The upcoming experience prototype phase will wrap up the discussions by inviting participants to watch a demonstration of E-I and ThingWiki in use. The demonstration will be an audiovisual performance. Participants will then be asked to reply to a structured online questionnaire.


## Analysis

### Main takeaways

(very early impressions of the meetings in april)

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.
