## Main takeaways

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.

# Study design

## Objectives

Through the workshops conducted during the reuse city lab in April 2021, new co-design concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them were turned into prototypes: ThingWiki (an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things) and E-I (an evaluation interface based on two earlier concept ideas).

The experience prototype will wrap up the discussions by inviting participants to watch a demonstration of E-I and ThingWiki in use. The demonstration will be a video performance. Participants will then be asked to reply to a structured questionnaire on the internet.

## Research questions

- RQ1. How can technologies that help find information about goods and materials be integrated into urban patterns of reuse?

## Participants

The experience prototype will invite the same participants who signed up the consent form for the reuse city co-design lab. New participants will be able to join as long as they fill the consent form.

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited by social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants. New participants will be invited via social media, as well as interest groups and communities such as Zero Waste Berlin, Motionlab, Zerbas Unite Berlin and Platform Coops Germany.
Study methodology

The participants will be sent a link that allows them to watch a video of the prototype in action, and reply to a structured questionnaire.
