# Design Research

One of the founding elements of OpenDoTT was Design Research. During the first year of the programme we had training modules offered by [STBY](https://www.stby.eu/) and [Quicksand](http://quicksand.co.in/). That foundation was incorporated in my research studies [Repair Journey](/opendott/studies/repair-journey) and [Ecosystem Mapping](/opendott/studies/ecosystem-mapping), which informed the creation of my eight [design concepts](/opendott/concepts). Design Research was also combined with other methodologies later in the [reuse.city](/opendott/studies/reuse-city) co-design lab and my speculative prototyping.
