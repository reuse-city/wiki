## Abstract

LATER

## Introduction

Waste is arguably one of the most explicit signs of the pervasiveness of global industrial production. A high - and growing - volume of manufactured goods is discarded every minute, in hyperconnected megacities as well as in isolated rural villages, and everything in between. The fact that most of that material is not reincorporated into production represents itself a systemic unbalance. Approaches such as cradle-to-cradle [REF], circular economy [REF] and the doughnut economy [REF] point to how unsustainable production paradigms currently are. Alternatively to a linear mode of production, often described as based on a single-directional "take / make / dispose" paradigm, authors and organisations active in those fields propose moving towards cyclic and regenerative practices. These are to be pursued chiefly through better design, materials science and new policy [REF]. Data on the environmental as well as financial impact of waste is used to back these predicaments [^1]. In that scenario, a boom of initiatives promoting regenerative practices organise themselves around themes such as zero waste, upcycling and the right to repair in all parts of the world.

With a handful of remarkable exceptions [FOOTNOTE? or mention later in the discussion section?], however, local and regional authorities seem largely blind to this discussion. And that scale - local and regional - is precisely the scale of public sector that is usually responsible for handling waste and materials discarded by local societies and businesses. Even when considerable investment is made into modernising public administration with the aid of technologies - notably on "smart city" initiatives -, little attention is paid to the importance of rethinking material flows towards regenerative systems. On the rare occasion that the subject of waste is addressed by smart city initiatives, the perspective is usually one of merely increasing the efficiency of waste collection. In other words, making discarded materials be transported quickly and at a lesser cost from households, businesses and other organisations to waste management facilities - where said materials are to be recycled, composted, incinerated or sent to landfills. And that is not enough [Footnote to Zero Waste panel titled "Recycling is not enough"].

When it comes to waste, consultancies and IT corporations working in the smart city scenario will rarely go beyond complying with WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) regulations for their own products. Gizmos such as "smart bins" [Footnote: Waste bins with sensors allowing waste management autorities to better track how filled they are and program collection more efficiently] are mentioned here and there, as if to justify public money being spent on hardware, without even consulting local societies. Remarkably, the waste management industry is well established and developed: over the last decades, technical and managerial improvements were made on the collection, sorting, recycling, incineration and landfilling of materials [REF]. However, those improvements pose little challenge to the dominant industrial paradigm of linear production. It can even be argued that focusing only on a higher efficiency of waste collection has detrimental effects as it hides from society the externalities of industrial production. Raising awareness about the volume of waste generated everyday and devising technologies that help society generate less waste - rather than cope with larger volumes of it - are nowhere to be seen.

My PhD research explores the overlapping points between systems-based sustainable alternatives for material flows (seeking circularity and other regenerative approaches); creating and developing technologies applied to improving the reuse of materials at a local and regional level (through a critical take on smart cities, maker culture and directed public investment); and socially inclusive possibilities (proposing a commons-based governance of materials looking at socio-economic inclusion and socio-environmental entrepreneurship).

In order to expand on ideas developed at earlier stages of investigation whilst adapting to the conditions of performing participatory research under the uncertainty of pandemic times, an online co-design lab was devised. As a way to focus attention on the topic of waste prevention at a local level through collective practices of reuse, it was named reuse.city. Its goal was to involve participants experienced with practices of reuse to refine earlier concept ideas and co-design improved concepts to be prototyped and carried forth at subsequent stages of research.

## Background

Along the first months of this PhD investigation, to the idea of adopting a critical perspective on smart cities was added a particular focus on issues around waste and reuse. Contributing to that was previous experience on different projects:

 - Leading a network of laboratories that promoted the reuse of discarded computers with a focus on social inclusion, called MetaReciclagem, active between 2003 and 2012 in Brazil. Within the same period, involvement with subprojects of MetaReciclagem such as the MutGamb editorial colletive and LixoEletrônico advocacy working group as well as collaboration with initiatives both in Brazil and abroad such as CulturaDigital.Br and the Bricolabs network.
 - A design residency exploring repair and upcycling with design students of VCUQ in Doha, leading to a first text on repair and the brazilian culture of gambiarra.
 - An open investigation exploring connections between maker cultures, repair and craft, taking place as a residency at Ping in Nantes (France), a short-term research fellowship at Leuphana University in Lüneburg, Germany, and further collaboration with organisations such as Instituto Procomum in Santos, Brazil.

As a way to better define the research boundaries for the PhD, two design research studies were conducted in the first year.

 - Repair Journey - seven participants were invited to keep a journal as they spent some weeks trying to repair or repurpose broken objects. They were then interviewed to discuss what were their challenges and discoveries along the way. The goal with the repair journey was to understand decisions at a personal or household level.
 - Ecosystem Mapping - five people whose work is related to the reuse or re-circulation of second-hand goods and materials were interviewed to compose an overview of the field. Here the focus was to understand at a city and regional scale how materials circulate.

The outputs of those studies, together with a literature review on related fields of knowledge, provided the basis for the creation of eight concept ideas for design. They advanced the goal of focusing on waste prevention rather than waste management, particularly on the reuse of goods and materials through local practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation.

## Designing the study

The reuse.city online co-design lab was created to further refine the concept ideas and build prototypes based on them, as well as to discuss what the implications of such prototypes would be in diverse real-world scenarios.

### Research questions

reuse.city seeks to expand the understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with:

 - assessing the potential value of discarded materials.
 - realising that value with the aid of digital tools and technologies, to the benefit of local society.

The study was designed to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the skills involved in the reuse of materials?
  - Can those skills they be augmented and replicated via digital systems?
  - What kind of hardware and software would be necessary for that?
- RQ2: what kind of facility can help improve the amount of materials that are reused in cities and regions?
  - Are there relevant experiences in place anywhere in the world that can inspire such systems? How can they be replicated and expanded?

### Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants. A total of 29 persons from ten different countries in four continents, signed up to the study by filling the consent form. Not all of the people who signed up have ultimately engaged with the lab activities.

### Study methodology

The reuse.city lab approached the research questions from different perspectives.

 - Expanding on some of the original concept ideas developed in the first year of research:
   - The Universal Registry of Things as informational groundwork - a multi-layered database of objects and materials about things and their repairability, spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling.
   - Hardware expanding on the original concept called Point and Reuse, taking shape as a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information about their potential for reuse.
 - Conducting meetings and workshops with participants interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. Documentation of the meetings was used to create updated concept ideas and to guide prototyping.
 - Prototyping and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a training module on open hardware.
 - An auto-ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, looking at how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials. Writing and notes from the exploration were part of the dialogue with participants as well as informed prototyping.

## Activities performed

Part of the groundwork for designing reuse.city was a training module on open leadership and internet health undertaken in 2020 as part of the OpenDoTT project. Already then, insights about the nature of open projects made their way into a blog post titled "A spiral of openness" [Footnote: aviable https://web.archive.org/web/20210116201101/https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/spiral-of-openness]. One among the (many) themes of that text was the distinction between starting a project from a particular idea, and growing a community based on the desire to connect on multiple levels with a group of people.

Of course, reuse.city is situated in a predefined institutional context that requires it to generate outputs to be later incorporated in project deliverables. [Footnote: For the sake of clarity: the OpenDoTT project, a EU-funded collaboration between Northumbria University and the Mozilla Foundation, requires every one of its 5 PhD candidates to generate a dataset consisting of participatory research activities based on earlier phases, as well as prototypes exploring open hardware to address issues of trust and internet health in the internet of things.] On the other hand, the horizon of potential collaboration may extend well beyond the timeline of this particular project. So instead of framing the recruitment and contact with participants only on what was being planned for estimated the four weeks of the lab, there was an intentional choice to make it feel as an invitation to an ongoing conversation that would not have started only then nor would it need to be closed soon.

### Week 1

For starters, there was a need to explore what exactly an online co-design lab would be. Lacking the possibility to spend time together on the same locality, digital content would then be used to trigger online interactions both simultaneous and asynchronous so as to fit different profiles of participants. A video introducing the study and posing the question "what a co-design lab should be" [Footnote video available on Web Archive: https://archive.org/details/reuse-welcome] was sent early on to the participants, together with a survey about their preferred means of interaction, and an invitation to meet online later in the same week.

It was early noted that the participants would have diverse levels of familiarity with the research topics and with studies developed earlier on this project. In order not to use up time of the calls to provide context, smaller videos presenting different parts of the research - called "fragments" - would then be offered as conversation triggers. The first one was about the choice of research topic (waste prevention and smart cities [Footnote video available on web archive https://archive.org/details/reuse-city-lab-fragment-waste-prevention-in-smart-cities]).

The date of April 9th was chosen for the first meeting to coincide with the international programme of activities "IoT day" organised by the Internet of Things Council. A group of participants were present on a video call that day to introduce themselves and were exposed to an overview of the research leading to reuse.city. There were discussions about reusing materials in very diverse local contexts - from advanced reuse centres in Finland to community workshops in a refugee camp in Uganda, as well as the limits of technology to provide solutions for waste materials.

### Week 2

As the group was composed of people spanning a wide range of timezones (from India to California), different time slots were offered from the second week on. Another video fragment, about design research and the studies developed in the first year, [Footnote video available on web archive https://archive.org/details/reuse-city-lab-fragment-design-research], was sent to the participants. They were also offered the opportunity to present their work or ideas about reuse and repair on the following week.

The first meeting had only one participant, and became more of an interview. It allowed for a deep immersion discussing particularities, tools and a systemic take on the reuse of materials. The second meeting had other three participants - two of which had joined the first session on week 1. They discussed structures or social/cultural practices for the reuse of materials participants saw on their local contexts. The idea was to learn about the kind of selection that these structures and practices imply, and whether it could be improved with technologies. Side conversations started to take place on the newly established communication spaces created following the survey sent out the previous week: an email-based discussion list, and a group on Telegram messaging platform.

### Week 3

Another video fragment [Footnote: video available on https://archive.org/details/reuse-city-lab-fragment-concept-ideas] was shared with participants, this one about concept ideas created in a previous phase of research. It was a way to prepare the participants to discuss the prototypes towards the end of the lab.

Following the call on the previous week, participants presented diverse projects, an interesting exposition of different whilst complimentary perspectives on reuse. Rhea Muthane shared her experience with a project called "100 ways of mending" and the Makeflix collective. Hugo Pilate has shown his experiments with speculative design of reused objects. Mark Philips reported on his long-term documentary photography covering repair cafes, reuse centres and other contexts in four continents. And finally, Fred Paulino has shown his work with the Gambiologia collective in Brazil exploring the aesthetics of improvisation and reuse. Tom Passmore presented Dsposal, a software solution to make waste compliance easier. A sixth presentation was cancelled due to health impediments.

### Week 4

In tandem with the calls with participants, prototyping was taking place with open hardware and software. As the programmed activities were reaching their end, the focus shifted to gather feedback on the way the concepts were evolving. A closing meeting was scheduled for April 30th, and attended by participants who had been to previous sessions. The group was introduced to updated versions of three prototypes:

- the universal registry of things, with the question whether it should be called "valudata";
- the evaluation interface E-I, taking mainly the shape of a workbench machine that could also be ported to a mobile app or adopt a larger kiosk form factor;
- transformation labs, a blueprint to establish reuse centres furnished with equipment and tools that at some points resembled those in community repair events, but also included others more common to fablabs and makerspaces.

The participants had the chance to discuss each of these prototypes and bring their insights and ideas, as well as contributing to an online collaborative graphic board using the Miro platform.

### Further interactions

Alternative ways to collect feedback from participants who didn't make it to the last meeting were also offered. Videos about each of the prototypes [Footnote: videos are available on web archive https://archive.org/details/reuse-city_prototypes] were shared as conversation triggers. The Miro board was kept open for a period of two weeks and received additional comments. In order to make collaboration easier to participants not familiar with Miro, a survey was also sent out and answered by other two participants.

## Results

At the end of the four weeks of meetings and the short period of collecting further contributions thereafter, updated versions of the concept ideas had been developed and at least partially prototyped. Extensive notes of the meetings are publicly available on GitHub, as well as the contents created to trigger conversation. Video recordings and transcriptions of the meetings and participants' presentations are to be made available soon enough as well.

As described, initially the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the Universal Registry of Things, had been slightly refined already in a session at an online workshop during the Mozilla Festival in March. The second was based on a concept idea designed previously called Point and Reuse - an app for mobile devices -, but during the lab was articulated in more abstract terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. It could still be thought of as a mobile app, but as experiments with prototyping in open hardware were being developed simultaneously, other forms and shapes were discussed and experimented with.

Through the online co-design lab, new concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them were turned into prototypes: an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things called ThingWiki, and a demonstration of technologies to enable E-I, in the form of a workbench machine.

Additionally, the conversations with participants suggested it was relevant to work also on a third concept idea not originally planned to be worked on at this stage of research: the transformation labs. As well as experimenting with technologies that would allow interested parties to assess the potential value of discarded materials, the online workshops brought forth also the discussion about what kind of urban facilities is needed to promote the reuse of materials, what were its precedents and relevant references, as well as main desirable characteristics.

The online lab provided the basis for prototyping thingwiki [Footnote: a working version can be found on https://thingwiki.herokuapp.com/ (accessed on 31/08/2021), snapshot on https://web.archive.org/web/20210831042905/https://thingwiki.herokuapp.com/ , and the ongoing backup of its contents can be found on this repository https://github.com/reuse-city/thingwiki ], the workbench version of E-I, and a draft blueprint of what should be taken into account when planning for urban transformation labs.

Finally, the period of planning, implementing and documenting the lab turned into a community building effort. Notes about insights and impressions about that aspect of reuse.city lab were also made. A great proportion of the participants have shown interested in maintaining the discussion for a longer period, which can be fruitful not only for coming phases of research but also to provide space for future impact on the world.

## Discussion

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.

Community in the making (spiral of openness)

## Conclusion

- Participants agreed to keep in touch after the study was finished. An e-mail list and a group in Telegram were used for that.
