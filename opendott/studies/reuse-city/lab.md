# reuse city lab

## Abstract

## Introduction

Waste is arguably one of the most explicit signs of how pervasive industrial production is. A growing volume of manufactured goods is discarded every minute in every part of the world - from hyperconnected megacities in Asia to isolated rural villages in Latin America. That very fact can be interpreted as a systemic lack of balance. Approaches such as cradle-to-cradle [REF], circular economy [REF] and the doughnut economy [REF] all point to the fact that most of contemporary industrial production is based on an unsustainable linear mode of production, superficially described as "take / make / dispose". Authors and organisations active in those fields propose moving towards cyclic and regenerative practices, to be pursued chiefly through better design, materials science and policy [REF]. Research on the environmental as well as financial impact of waste is used to back these predicaments. Initiatives that try to promote regenerative practices organise themselves around themes such as zero waste, upcycling and the right to repair.

And yet, with remarkable exceptions [FOOTNOTE? or mention later in the discussion section?], local and regional authorities seem largely blind to that discussion. Public institutions on those scales are generally the ones responsible for handling waste and discarded materials. Even when considerable investment is made into modernising public administration with the aid of technologies, little attention is paid to the importance of rethinking material flows. On the rare occasion that the subject is discussed, the perspective is usually one of increasing the productivity of waste collection. In other words, making materials go quickly and affordably from households, businesses and other organisations to waste management facilities - where they will be recycled, composted, incinerated or sent to treated landfills.

## Background

 - repair journey
 - ecosystem mapping
 - past projects (residences in Doha and Nantes, visit to LÃ¼neburg, course in Santos)
 - literature review. valoriste.
 - concept ideas

## Methodology

! Copying and pasting from [here](../reuse-city), need to work on it still.

### Research questions

reuse.city seeks to expand understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with
 - assessing the potential value of discarded materials.
 - realising that value with the aid of digital technologies.

It is expected to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the skills involved in the reuse of materials?
  - Can those skills they be augmented and replicated via digital systems?
  - What kind of hardware and software would be necessary for that?
- RQ2: what kind of facility can help improve the amount of materials that are reused in cities and regions?
  - Are there relevant experiences in place anywhere in the world that can inspire such systems?

### Participants

The reuse.city co-design lab recruited 29 participants from ten different countries in four continents, all of which signed up to the study and filled the [consent form](/opendott/studies/reuse-city/ethics). Not all of the people who signed up have engaged with the lab activities.

### Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants.

### Study methodology

The reuse.city lab approached the [research questions](#research-questions) from different perspectives.

 - Expanding on original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) developed in the first year of research:
   - The [Universal Registry of Things](/opendott/concept-ideas/universal-registry) as informational groundwork - a multi-layered database of objects and materials about things and their repairability, spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling.
   - Hardware based on the concept of [Point and Reuse](/opendott/concept-ideas/point-reuse): a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information.
 - Conducting meetings and workshops with [participants](#participants) interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials.
 - [Prototyping](/opendott/prototypes) and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a [training module on open hardware](/opendott/training/open-hardware).
 - An auto-ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, looking at how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials.

## Results

In implementation, it became also an opportunity to start building an international community of stakeholders experienced in activities of reuse and repair.

### Co-designed updated concepts / prototypes

- [ThingWiki](/opendott/prototypes/thingwiki)
- [Transformation Labs](/opendott/prototypes/transformation-labs)

### Community building

- Participants agreed to keep in touch after the study was finished. An e-mail list and a group in Telegram were used for that.


## Activities

The lab took place initially as a series of meetings and online discussions in April 2021. As well as refining the concept ideas and informing their prototyping, the reuse.city co-design lab became also an opportunity to put in practice community-building and open methodologies.

Initially, the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the universal registry of things, had already been refined in a session at Mozfest 2021. The second was based on point-and-reuse, but was articulated in more abstract terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. For discussion purposes, E-I could still be thought of as an app for mobile devices, but in tandem with the open hardware training and expected tech demonstrations, it is being prototyped as a workbench machine with similar functionality.

Through the workshops conducted in April, new co-design concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them are currently being turned into prototypes: ThingWiki (an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things) and E-I (an evaluation interface based on two earlier concept ideas).

The upcoming experience prototype phase will wrap up the discussions by inviting participants to watch a demonstration of E-I and ThingWiki in use. The demonstration will be an audiovisual performance. Participants will then be asked to reply to a structured online questionnaire.

## Analysis



### Main takeaways

(very early impressions of the meetings in april)

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.
