## Abstract

LATER

## Introduction

Waste is arguably one of the most explicit signs of the pervasiveness of global industrial production. A high - and growing - volume of manufactured goods is discarded every minute, in hyperconnected megacities as well as isolated rural villages and everything in between. That itself represents a systemic unbalance. Approaches such as cradle-to-cradle [REF], circular economy [REF] and the doughnut economy [REF] point to how unsustainable production paradigms currently are. Alternatively to a linear mode of production, superficially described as "take / make / dispose", authors and organisations active in those fields propose moving towards cyclic and regenerative practices. These are to be pursued chiefly through better design, materials science and policy [REF]. Data on the environmental as well as financial impact of waste is used to back these predicaments [Footnote about reports from international agencies for environment and development]. Within that scenario, uncountable initiatives trying to promote regenerative practices organise themselves around themes such as zero waste, upcycling and the right to repair in all parts of the world.

With remarkable exceptions [FOOTNOTE? or mention later in the discussion section?] however, local and regional authorities seem largely blind to that kind of discussion. And that  - local and regional - is precisely the scale of public sector usually responsible for handling waste and materials discarded by local societies and businesses. Even when considerable investment is made into modernising public administration with the aid of technologies - notably on "smart city" initiatives -, little attention is paid to the importance of rethinking material flows. On the rare occasion that the subject is discussed, the perspective is usually one of increasing the efficiency of waste collection. In other words, making discarded materials be transported quickly and affordably from households, businesses and other organisations to waste management facilities - where said materials will be recycled, composted, incinerated or sent to landfills.

When it comes to waste, consultancies and IT corporations active in the smart city scenario will rarely go beyond complying with WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) regulations for their own products. Gizmos such as "smart bins" are mentioned here and there, as if to justify public money being spent on hardware. Granted, the waste management industry is well established and developed: over the last decades, technical and managerial improvements were made on the collection, sorting, recycling, incineration and landfilling of materials [REF]. However, those improvements pose little challenge to the dominant linear production paradigm. Raising awareness about the volume of waste generated everyday and devising technologies that help society generate less waste - rather than cope with more of it - are nowhere to be seen.

My PhD research explores the overlapping points between systems-based sustainable alternatives for material flows (seeking circularity and other regenerative approaches); the technologic development applied to improve public administration at a local and regional level (through a critical take on smart cities, maker culture and directed public investment); and socially inclusive possibilities (proposing commons-based governance of materials looking at socio-economic inclusion).

In order to expand on ideas developed on earlier stages of investigation whilst adapting to the conditions of performing participatory research under the uncertainty of pandemic times, an online co-design lab was devised. As a way to focus attention on the topic of waste prevention at a local level through collective practices of reuse, it was named reuse.city. Its goal was to invite participants involved with practices of reuse to refine earlier concept ideas and co-design improved concepts to be prototyped.


## Background

TODO Background:

 - repair journey
 - ecosystem mapping
 - past projects (residences in Doha and Nantes, visit to LÃ¼neburg, course in Santos)
 - literature review. valoriste.
 - concept ideas

## Methodology

! Copying and pasting from [here](../reuse-city), need to work on it still.

### Research questions

reuse.city seeks to expand understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with
 - assessing the potential value of discarded materials.
 - realising that value with the aid of digital technologies.

It is expected to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the skills involved in the reuse of materials?
  - Can those skills they be augmented and replicated via digital systems?
  - What kind of hardware and software would be necessary for that?
- RQ2: what kind of facility can help improve the amount of materials that are reused in cities and regions?
  - Are there relevant experiences in place anywhere in the world that can inspire such systems?

### Participants

The reuse.city co-design lab recruited 29 participants from ten different countries in four continents, all of which signed up to the study and filled the [consent form](/opendott/studies/reuse-city/ethics). Not all of the people who signed up have engaged with the lab activities.

### Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants.

### Study methodology

The reuse.city lab approached the [research questions](#research-questions) from different perspectives.

 - Expanding on original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) developed in the first year of research:
   - The [Universal Registry of Things](/opendott/concept-ideas/universal-registry) as informational groundwork - a multi-layered database of objects and materials about things and their repairability, spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling.
   - Hardware based on the concept of [Point and Reuse](/opendott/concept-ideas/point-reuse): a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information.
 - Conducting meetings and workshops with [participants](#participants) interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials.
 - [Prototyping](/opendott/prototypes) and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a [training module on open hardware](/opendott/training/open-hardware).
 - An auto-ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, looking at how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials.

## The lab

Spiral of openness. Build as we go. Provide different means of interaction for different particpiants. Create triggers for conversations.

1. Introduction: getting to know participants, deciding how to move forward. IoT day. Introducing my research. Video:

Expectation:

1.1. grow a community. Reuse materials in local contexts. People already interested. How to communicate? What is an open design lab? Let's build it together. Work with people who are already interested. How to start?

1.2. Why reuse?

1.3. IoT day. Tech won't solve, but can start conversations.

2. Fragments.

2nd week

Before this week's sessions, or even in parallel if you are not able to join in, I would like you to tell the others and myself what kinds of structures or social/cultural practices for the reuse of materials you see in your own context.

For instance, in the neighbourhood where I live in Berlin, people will often leave clothes, furniture and appliances to be donated practically everywhere. At the lobby of a residential building, in front of one's home, at a park or in the donation points present in many streets. Is this kind of practice common where you live? Or else, do you know of something similar in another city or town?

As well as sharing and talking about those stories, I want also to learn more about what kind of selection takes place. Do people give away things to strangers, or only among friends and family? And particularly for the purposes of the lab: how decisions about where and how to treat materials are made? Who are the people making that call? What is their background? What are their challenges? Could they get more effective if something was different?

As some of you already know, I want to explore the idea of expanding the ability to assess and decide whether objects and materials can be repaired or transformed, if it has value in second-hand markets, etc. Identifying that in action is very important.

I'm looking forward to this week's meetings, and hope to talk to all of you.

## Activities performed

The lab took place initially as a series of meetings and online discussions in April 2021. As well as refining the concept ideas and informing their prototyping, the reuse.city co-design lab became also an opportunity to put in practice community-building and open methodologies.

Initially, the lab focused on two of the original concept ideas. The first one, the universal registry of things, had already been refined in a session at Mozfest 2021. The second was based on point-and-reuse, but was articulated in more abstract terms as "Evaluation Interface", or E-I. For discussion purposes, E-I could still be thought of as an app for mobile devices, but in tandem with the open hardware training and expected tech demonstrations, it is being prototyped as a workbench machine with similar functionality.

Through the workshops conducted in April, new co-design concepts based on the original concept ideas were developed. Two of them are currently being turned into prototypes: ThingWiki (an experimental implementation of the Universal Registry of Things) and E-I (an evaluation interface based on two earlier concept ideas).

The upcoming experience prototype phase will wrap up the discussions by inviting participants to watch a demonstration of E-I and ThingWiki in use. The demonstration will be an audiovisual performance. Participants will then be asked to reply to a structured online questionnaire.

## Discussion

 - Importance of physical space. Reuse centres. Participants brought examples. Tools, materials. Storage is very important. Leave materials idle for future use.
 - Mobility: there are few places to get materials fixed (example participant in the US). My response: miniature workshops on top of bikes?
 - Wikipedia-inspired approach for the URT. My take: individual/personal contribution as well as automatic and institutional. Best metaphor might be free/open source software instead of wikipedia. In any case, "wiki" is understandable nowadays.

Community in the making (spiral of openness)

## Conclusion

- Participants agreed to keep in touch after the study was finished. An e-mail list and a group in Telegram were used for that.
