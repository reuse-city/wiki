At the current stage - August 2020 - of the [OpenDoTT project](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott), I am working on design concepts that respond to data collected in this [first year of work](../research-progress). The data comes from two design research studies; my explorations towards literature review; and reflection upon projects I have been involved with in the past.

My investigation is focused on *smart cities* with a strong emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as ownership and sovereignty. I am directing my attention in particular to waste management, but with a specific take on it. I want to contribute with solutions to avoid as much as possible the very need to manage waste in the usual way and to encourage instead the *reuse of materials* in cities and towns through initiatives of *repair and repurposing* aimed at and run by *local actors*.

This sort of initiative is arguably nothing new, as people have been repairing, repurposing and recirculating things since forever. These practices, however, are seldom pictured in discussions about smart cities.
