## 09/11/2024 - scoping my research

*Felipe Schmidt Fonseca*

In the first months of doctoral investigation (2019-2020) I had to decide on, circumscribe and define my research focus. OpenDoTT had assigned me the topic "Smart Cities", and I was allowed - or rather expected - to engage critically with it. Upon getting familiarised with the topic - to which attending the conference "Beyond Smart Cities Today" in Rotterdam was essential -, I had a panorama of the scenario. There was already enough being written about the most obvious shortcoming of the smart city rhetoric: the lack of real participation, the imposition of a techno-solutionist perspective, a very superficial understanding of what the main issues in cities are. Part of my [literature review](/opendott/thesis/literature.md) is dedicated to those elements. Still, I was not drawn to a generic critique, nor did I feel I could contribute to the most visible issues of smart city technology such as surveillance, lighting, inventory, transportation.

I had arrived in Dundee ready to start a new chapter in my life. There were many strands of my previous projects that could feed the doctoral investigation, but I wasn't leaning onto any one in particular. I soon wrote - briefly, and in Portuguese about the move and published on [medium](https://felipefonseca.medium.com/de-cidade-em-cidade-7cf9ae19b831). In that first blog post I listed other pieces I had written in the past that mentioned cities as sites of social innovation, made connections between online communities and urban ones, and challenged the smart city.

As a side note, writing and posting on medium was itself a first exercise on documenting my research, always a meta-topic in my work. I would later start using a [subsection of my personal website](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) as my research blog, and a couple of years in did set up [this wiki](/home.md) to document my findings and explorations on a non-linear way.

In any case, my experience as a foreigner looking to settle in a city I had never been to opened my perception to expectations, assumptions and affordances. I made extensive notes on my journals about those, and tried to explore questions such as "what is the opposite of a smart city?" or what would be a "healthy smart city". Over the months, however, my attention was drawn to a topic that had been present in many phases of my previous career. Over the following years, I entertained diverse forms of even describing it, and that process was itself quite rich. But to make it as short as possible in this wiki note, the topic I started to focus on was waste. In particular, how materials that could still function end up being wasted instead of reused.

I didn't find much about waste on smart city literature, and the little I was able to find was off the mark for the kind of reflection I wanted to conduct. Those references were excessively focused on improvements to the efficiency of waste collection and recycling. By that time there was an interesting investigation by NPR on how [plastics recycling can be interpreted as an industry-led scam](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled?t=1613119529041&t=1656239015723). Meanwhile, I walked the streets of Dundee observing the materiality of refuse, took more notes, made photos. Some of those images are collected [here](/opendott/slides/2020_street-matter.pdf) (PDF) and were instrumental when I started designing my first [research studies](/opendott/studies). I expect to return to those photos at some point to organise a publication or exhibition based on them.

As waste, waste prevention, repairs and reuse of materials took a prominent spot in my research, I kept writing about the topic. As a sort of public-facing reflection. Here are some examples of blog posts I made during that initial period:

- Blog Post: [Reparatur Festival](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/reparatur-festival-2019) (2019).
- Blog Post: [Things in the City](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/things-in-the-city) (2019).
- Blog Post: [Waste in my life](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/waste-in-my-life) (2020).
- Blog Post: [City Mattering](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/city-mattering) (2020) (Also on [Makery](https://www.makery.info/en/2020/03/13/city-mattering/)).
