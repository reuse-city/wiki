# reuse.city
## online co-design lab (March-August 2021)

reuse.city is a research study exploring waste prevention in smart cities. In earlier phases of the [PhD research on waste prevention and smart cities](/opendott), two studies were carried out: the [repair journey](/opendott/studies/repair-journey) and an [ecosystem mapping](/opendott/studies/ecosystem-mapping). Respectively, the studies identified participants’ behaviours towards broken objects, and how unwanted materials circulate in society before they are discarded. Building on such prior activities, reuse.city aims at co-designing technologies, methods and communication to promote the reuse of second hand goods and materials in cities and regions through practices of repair, upcycling and re-circulation.

## Objectives

The main goal of reuse.city is to co-design ways to expand the ability to reuse goods and materials in cities and regions, particularly with the aid of networked digital tecnologies. A secondary objective is to investigate social as well as cultural aspects that influence the reuse of goods and materials.

The research objectives are to be accomplished by three sets of activities conducted in parallel:

 - engaging with an international group of participants in an online co-design lab
 - building prototypes of technology to help assess the potential value of goods and materials
 - conducting ethnographic fieldwork in the city of Berlin

## Research questions

reuse.city seeks to expand understanding of the diverse skills and abilities involved with
 - assessing the potential value of discarded materials
 - realising that value with the aid of digital technologies.

It is expected to address the following research questions:

- RQ1: what are the skills involved in the reuse of materials? Can they be augmented and replicated via digital systems? What kind of hardware and software is necessary for that?
- RQ2: what kind of facility can help improve the amount of materials that are reused in cities and regions? Are there relevant experiences in place anywhere in the world that can inspire such systems?

## Participants

The reuse.city co-design lab recruited 29 participants from 10 different countries in four continents which signed up to the study and filled the [consent form](/opendott/studies/reuse-city-lab/ethics).

## Recruitment

The participants of reuse city lab were recruited via social media, invited personally by the researcher or suggested by colleagues and other participants.

## Study methodology

As a whole, reuse.city approaches the [research questions](#research-questions) from three complementary perspectives:

 - the reuse.city co-design lab was created expand on the original [concept ideas](/opendott/concept-ideas) developed in the first year of research, by involving [participants](#participants) interested in and/or engaged with the reuse of second-hand goods and materials. It was based on a combination of two concept ideas: a multi‐layered database of objects and materials (“universal registry of things”); and a machine that identifies objects against the database and displays information about their repairability,
 spare parts, authorised repair shops, and possibilities for reuse and recycling.
 - prototyping and experimenting with digital technologies to promote the reuse of materials in tandem with a [training module on open hardware](/opendott/training/open-hardware).
 - an ethnographic exploration of reuse in the city of Berlin, and how the prototypes could impact on the reuse of materials.
