## Presentations

### Reuse datasets for alternative circularities of products and materials

**Circular Berlin**

*Berlin / Online, 2024*

**Description:**

Despite recent advancements in terms of legislation and industrial practices, a fully closed-loop economy is not yet feasible in the foreseeable future. In such a scenario, recycling won’t be enough to cope with the growing volume of goods being manufactured every day, in the whole world. 
Felipe Schmidt Fonseca's PhD research (Northumbria University / Mozilla Foundation) explored convivial approaches to create socially inclusive local systems of waste prevention that help divert potentially reusable materials from the waste stream. This presentation will focus on “reuse datasets”, a design concept developed during Felipe´s investigation to help seek alternative circularities through commons-based governance of data relevant for the reuse of products and materials.

- [Blog post](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/fixfest-uk-2020) about the session.

**Description:**

> The treatment of solid waste is often seen as an engineering problem whose solution is to be entirely outsourced to private corporations that will either recycle stuff (in its industrial meaning – transform them back into raw materials) or dispose of them in landfills or incinerators. However, a significant proportion of the typical municipal waste could be reused and repurposed before such final and environmentally intensive measures. 
The purpose of this session is to discuss what sort of policies, infrastructure and governance schemes could help society reuse more of the materials it currently discards.
Researcher Felipe Schmidt Fonseca starts with his experiences in Brazil in computer reuse, but takes us on a critical journey through concepts of the "smart city" and "internet of things". 

### The wheres and whens of networks
