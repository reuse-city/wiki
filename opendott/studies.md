# Studies

My research was developed through critical reflection of literature and context, experimentation and a series of research studies grounded on methods of design research and participatory action research. Three research studies were registered and approved by my Universities' ethics committees:

- [Repair Journey](/opendott/studies/repair-journey);
- [Ecosystem Mapping](/opendott/studies/ecosystem-mapping);
- [reuse.city](/opendott/studies/reuse-city).

During the final stretch of research, I have not conducted any research study with participants, but engaged in activities of auto-ethnography, participant observation and critical experimentation.
