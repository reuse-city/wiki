# Studies

My research was developed through critical reflection of literature and context, experimentation and a series of research studies grounded on methods of design research and participatory action research. Three research studies were registered and approved by my Universities' ethics committees:

- An initial [design research](/opendott/studies/design-research) phase, composed of two studies:
  - [Repair Journey](/opendott/studies/repair-journey);
  - [Ecosystem Mapping](/opendott/studies/ecosystem-mapping);
- An international online co-design lab called [reuse.city](/opendott/studies/reuse-city).

During the final stretch of research, I have not conducted any new research study with participants. I have however engaged with the fields related to my research, the outputs of my previous studies and my life experience prior to the PhD inspired by auto-ethnography and reflective practice. Loose notes and other materials about that stage can be found in the page [on generosity](/opendott/studies/on-generosity).
