# Design Concepts

Ideas created by Reuse City to promote the collaborative reuse of goods and materials.

Mixing research, advocacy and concrete projects, Reuse City creates research-backed design concepts to help the mission of promoting a greater reuse of goods and materials in contemporary society. Our chief design concepts are featured below:

- [ThingData](/concepts/thingdata) - an openly governed database about the reuse of goods and materials. If helps diverse stakeholders engaged with repairs, upcycling and recirculation assess the potential value of materials.
- [Reuse Commons](/concepts/reuse-commons) - an open toolkit to create local and collaborative reuse systems. It allows communities to establish protocols and create their circular systems.
- [Transformation Labs](/concept/transformation-labs) - physical infrastructure in cities to enable local groups to repair, transform and adapt goods and materials. They provide the concrete means and knowledge for the extension of product lifetime.
- [School of Reuse](/concepts/school) - providing contemporary educational solutions for the reuse and repair sectors.
