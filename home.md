# Reuse City Wiki

Hi. I am Felipe Schmidt Fonseca (more about me [here](https://is.efeefe.me)). This wiki starts as a way to document my ongoing [PhD research](/opendott) in an open and unstructured way.

## 1. OpenDoTT

OpenDoTT ("Open Design of Trusted Things") is "a PhD programme to explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things". The [project](https://opendott.org) has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508. The doctoral training started in 2019 at the University of Dundee and later the whole project moved to Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The industrial partner is the Mozilla Foundation, as well as other partners that compose the OpenDoTT consortium.

The working title of my research is "waste prevention in generous cities". More information can be found in the links below:

## Wiki.js and git backup

The website was built using [wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). I am trying to use its ability to sync to a git repository ([this one](https://github.com/reuse-city/wiki/), to be specific). At the present moment, this feature is not completely stable - I had to downgrade wiki.js in order to import a previous backup. I hope the developers improve it in the near future. This is important as a way to future-proof the contents of this website in the shape of markdown files stored under a folder structure that is as software-agnostic as possible without losing its human readability.
