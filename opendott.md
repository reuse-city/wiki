Between July 2019 and June 2022, I was a Marie Curie Early Stage Research fellow at [OpenDoTT](#opendott). Initially at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design (University of Dundee), and from June 2020 until June 2023 at the School of Arts, Design and Social Sciences of Northumbria University in Newcastle upon Tyne.

The research topic assigned to me in the project was "smart cities", under the following description:

> Technology is fundamentally changing how cities work, but these smart cities are most often determined in a top-down fashion, with little transparency or accountability in how data influences the workings of the city. Can we create cities that are not just smarter, but kinder, fairer and more citizen-centred?

Upon early exploration and reflection about my potential contribution to scholarship, the research focus I adopted was waste prevention through community-based practices of reuse. The final title of my thesis was *"Generous cities – weaving commons-oriented systems for the reuse of excess materials in urban contexts"*.

## OpenDoTT

OpenDoTT (Open Design of Trusted Things) was "a PhD programme from Northumbria University and Mozilla to explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things". The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508. [More info (CORDIS)](https://doi.org/10.3030/813508).

The original [project description](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517154503/https://opendott.org/) was the following:

> The challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) require interdisciplinary thinking. OpenDoTT will train five Early Stage Researchers with backgrounds in design, technology, arts and activism to create and advocate for connected products that are more open, secure, and trustworthy.
