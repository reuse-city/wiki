[OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) (Open Design of Trusted Things) "is a PhD programme from Northumbria University and Mozilla to  explore how to build a more open, secure, and trustworthy Internet of Things". The project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 813508.

> The challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) require interdisciplinary thinking. OpenDoTT will train five Early Stage Researchers with backgrounds in design, technology, arts and activism to create and advocate for connected products that are more open, secure, and trustworthy.

My research topic is "waste prevention and smart cities". In the following links you can find more information about it.
