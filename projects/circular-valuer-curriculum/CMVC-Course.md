# Circular Material Valuer - Course

*Part of the [Circular Material Valuer Curriculum](/projects/circular-valuer-curriculum) project.*

***Sample Course Programme***

This page describes the **Circular Material Valuer**, a 15-week project-based course programme designed to equip individuals and organizations with the skills and mindset needed to divert valuable goods from the waste stream. It combines theoretical learning with hands-on, reflective activities to foster a holistic understanding of material reuse from a critical, ground-level perspective.

The programme has four modules, each designed to build upon the former, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of the Circular Material Valuer's role.

The programme has four modules:

1. Systemic View and Social Value  
2. Eyes and Hands of a Circular Valuer  
3. Information Systems and Economic Value  
4. Stories and Personal Value

The Course Programme is an *Open Educational Resource* published with a [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence. It can be freely adapted for self-study, workshops, or training programmes.

## Module 1: Systemic View and Social Value

This module provides the foundational knowledge for trainees, enabling them to critically understand the circular economy and its social-ecological implications. It challenges traditional notions of waste and linear production, promoting a more equitable and sustainable interaction with materials, and framing local actions as vital systemic interventions.

**Module Length:** *4 weeks (2-3 hours per week).*

### Core Competencies

* **Critical Thinking:** Analysing mainstream discourse on product design, manufacturing, waste management and circular economy, identifying potentialities and shortcomings on these topics in relation to local systems for material reuse.  
* **Systems Mapping:** Visualising local and regional material flows, stakeholder networks, and communication channels.  
* **Community Engagement:** Understanding, engaging with, and leveraging existing social groups and initiatives.  
* **Ethical Framing:** Shifting from a passive "abundance" mindset to an intentional "generosity" mindset.

### Methods

* **Theoretical Sessions:** Introduce key concepts like the waste hierarchy, bioregions, and the critiques of top-down circularity. Use readings and videos to spark discussion. The **agent valoriste** role in the French context will be introduced as a professional model in the social and solidarity economy.  
* **Participatory Workshops:** Use **generative questions** to facilitate group discussions on local challenges and opportunities for waste prevention. Map stakeholders, resources, and material flows in a chosen locality.  
* **Case Studies:** Examine successful and unsuccessful initiatives in local and global contexts, such as community *repair cafés*, scrap shops like The Remakery, or historical models like the SERO System in East Germany.

### Assignments

* **Local System Mapping:** Participants create a map of their city or neighbourhood, identifying relevant actors involved in retail and distribution, repair, reuse, and waste (e.g., formal waste facilities, informal donation points, repair shops, charities).  
* **Stakeholder Interview:** Conduct a brief interview with a repairer, charity shop worker, or waste picker \- either from local context or experiences elsewhere \- to gain insight into their work and perspective.

**Main Module Outcome**

* **Local Reuse Plan:** Start developing a community-oriented project to promote or increase material reuse with a focus on supporting urban generosity, generating exchange among local stakeholders, promoting community education, and producing social-environmental value.

## Module 2: Eyes and Hands of a Circular Valuer

This module is dedicated to developing the practical and embodied skills necessary for a material valuer, from initial assessment to hands-on intervention.

**Module Length:** *4 weeks (3-4 hours per week).*

### **Core Competencies**

* **Material Assessment:** Performing inspections of objects in visual, manual, functional, and socio-environmental terms.  
* **Repair & Upcycling:** Executing simple hands-on repairs and creative transformations.  
* **Resourcefulness:** Using basic tools and available materials to solve problems.  
* **Design Literacy:** Analysing product design for durability, repairability, and obsolescence.

### Methods

* **Hands-on Labs:** Conduct workshops focused on disassembling and assessing different products (e.g., a broken electronic device, a worn-out piece of furniture) \- inspired by embodied approaches to learning through practical work.  
* **Skill-Sharing Sessions:** Invite a craftsperson, a professional repairer, or a seasoned upcycler to lead a practical session, embodying models of learning inspired by “master and apprentice” modes, “peer learning”, and “tactile education”.  
* **Materiality Experiments:** Work with a single type of waste material (e.g., discarded wood, plastic bottles) exploring its properties and potential for transformation through minimal intervention.

### Assignments

* **Repair Diary:** Participants choose a broken or unwanted object and document their repair or upcycling journey, including attempts, failures, and discoveries, using photos or sketches. This reflects a core methodology of the initial research phase.  
* **The "Reshape" Project:** Apply the "Reshape strategy" to an item of industrial waste, transforming its function, form, or composition into a new product.  
* **Tool Kit Development:** Create a small "tool kit" of simple, multi-purpose tools and document their use for various repair and upcycling tasks.

**Main Module Outcome**

* **Material Guide:** create a guidebook with recommendations on how to assess the value of goods available locally for reuse. Document relevant characteristics \- material properties, typical operations needed, seasonal demand and others.

## Module 3: Information Systems and Economic Value

This module focuses on the economic and data-driven aspects of material reuse, training participants to use available resources and develop sustainable business models.

**Module Length:** *3 weeks (2-3 hours per week).*

### Core Competencies

* **Data Literacy:** Collecting, analysing, and contributing to open data about reuse.  
* **Economic Valuation:** Assessing market value and social value, identifying market gaps, and creating viable solidarity-oriented business models.  
* **Logistics & Storage:** Managing material flows, inventories, and storage solutions.  
* **Policy Advocacy:** Understanding incentive systems and advocating for supportive policies.

### Methods

* **Online Research Labs:** Use online marketplaces and databases to research the market characteristics of different materials and products. Explore tools online second-hand marketplaces for information on pricing and potential social demand.  
* **Business Models:** Apply business model frameworks to develop and critique a business plan for a reuse-focused initiative.  
* **Data Analysis Session:** Work with open data sets (e.g., from the Open Repair Alliance) to analyse repair trends, common failure points, and the impact of reuse.

### Assignments

* **Material Flow Report:** Document the journey of a specific material (e.g., textiles, wood) in your city and propose a digital inventory system for it, referencing tools like The Restart Project's Fixometer.  
* **Policy Proposal:** Research the existence of local, regional and national policies and write reflections on how they can be used to encourage reuse.  
* **Market Analysis:** Conduct a market survey for a chosen second-hand item or material and present a pricing strategy for a social enterprise or reuse shop.  
* **Contextual Considerations:** research how value is perceived and assigned in different regions.

**Main Module Outcome**

* **Data Strategy:** Develop a strategy for data collection and analysis to support local and regional material reuse \- choose between available digital tools for inventory, evaluation and communications.
