# Material Valuer - Online Survey

As part of the citizen science project [Circular Material Valuer Curriculum](/projects/circular-valuer-curriculum), we are conducting an online survey to learn from people experienced in the activities of Material Valuers. Please read the Participant Information below **before contributing**. If you understand and agree with the following, please submit your answers via [this form](https://forms.gle/16ULM7ydC4sKdmje6).

## Participant Information

You are invited to take part in a citizen science project. Please read the information provided below. This will help you to understand why and how the research is being carried out and what your participation will involve. You are welcome to contact us to clarify any questions via email on felipe@globalinnovationgathering.org before participating in this survey.

### What is the purpose of the research?

The project's central goal is to better understand the importance of Material Valuers in circular systems. It will document the knowledge, skills, experience, sensitivity and processes required for the activities of professionals, volunteers and hobbyists who analyse the potential reuse of goods and materials. All the public research data and ongoing outputs will be published with open licences. More information can be found on the following website:

https://wiki.reuse.city/en/projects/circular-valuer-curriculum

### Who is conducting the research?

Dr. Felipe Schmidt Fonseca is leading this survey on behalf of *Global Innovation Gathering e.V.* ("GIG"), as part of the project Circular Material Valuer Curriculum. The research team is also composed of other GIG members.

### Who is funding the research?

The research project is funded by the Hans Sauer Stiftung, in the program "[Citizen Science for Action!](https://www.hanssauerstiftung.de/forderprogramm/2024-2025/)".

### What will happen if I take part?

You will reply to the questions on the online form. Your answers will be collected and analysed together with those of other participants. You may receive occasional follow-up questions at the discretion of the research team. You can choose whether to have your identity associated with the data you provide or to be mentioned via a pseudonym.

### What are the possible benefits of taking part?

You can expect to better understand what you do and how it relates to the emerging professional role of Circular Material Valuer. You will also have the option to join an online discussion group on the reuse of materials with participants from around the world.

The information acquired by the researcher team will help GIG create a curriculum and further educational projects aiming at material handling practices more beneficial to society at large, facing issues of economic inequality and environmental impact. All the outputs will be published with open licences.

### Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?

The survey form is divided in four sections: personal information, demographic information, survey questions, and additional questions. Each section is identified as whether mandatory or optional, and whether your responses will be kept private or made public:

- Personal information (mandatory, private);
- Demographic information (optional, public);
- Survey questions (optional, public);
- Additional questions (optional, private).

Initially, the private information you submit through the online form (sections "personal" and "additional") will be handled solely by the lead researcher. You can inform your real name or choose a pseudonym.

All your public answers (sections "demographic" and "survey questions") will be accessed by the research team.

Selected parts of your public responses deemed relevant for discussion may be shared with other participants. Quotes, excerpts, and analyses of the research data – either literal or paraphrased – may be featured for research purposes in outputs such as articles, papers, maps, diagrams, open online datasets, and other lawful uses. Using your name or a pseudonym will be respected in any such outputs.

You can access the research outputs in the project repository at https://github.com/reuse-city/CMVC, or request the researcher to share any outcomes by email once they are produced.

### Data Protection

Your name and contact details, as well as demographic data such as age group, location, and affiliation, will be collected and processed in this study. GIG asserts that it is lawful for it to process your data in this project, as the processing is necessary for performing a task in the public interest. You fill out the survey form voluntarily. GIG is the data controller for the personal and/or special categories of personal data processed in this project.

If you wish to update, access, erase, or limit the use of your information, please let us know by emailing Dr. Felipe Schmidt Fonseca at felipe@globalinnovationgathering.org. Please note that some of your rights may be limited when information has already been featured in research outputs such as articles, papers and others, but we are happy to discuss that with you.
