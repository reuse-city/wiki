# Solutions

Mixing research, advocacy and concrete projects, Reuse City creates research-backed solutions to help the mission of promoting a greater reuse of goods and materials in contemporary society. Our chief solutions are featured below:

- [ThingData](/solutions/thingdata) - an openly governed database about the reuse of goods and materials. If helps diverse stakeholders engaged with repairs, upcycling and recirculation assess the potential value of materials.
- [Reuse Commons](/solutions/reuse-commons) - an open toolkit to create local and collaborative reuse systems. It allows communities to establish protocols and create their circular systems.
- [Reuse Academy](/solutions/academy) - dynamic educational solutions for the reuse and repair sectors.

<!-- - [School of Reuse](/solutions/school) - providing contemporary educational solutions for the reuse and repair sectors. ## project renamed to Reuse Academy -->
<!-- - [Transformation Labs](/solutions/transformation-labs) - physical infrastructure in cities to enable local groups to repair, transform and adapt goods and materials. They provide the concrete means and knowledge for the extension of product lifetime. -->
