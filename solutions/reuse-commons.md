# Reuse Commons

Reuse Commons is a toolkit to help create commons-based local systems for the reuse of excess materials. It operates on three layers of articulation:

- Generative Mapping
- Stakeholder Profiles
- Exchange Protocols

## Generative Mapping

Reuse Commons starts from a geographic map of the city or region, on top of which participants locate actors in multiple sectors that can potentially integrate their reuse commons: repair professionals, hardware stores, waste sorting centres, recycling facilities, second-hand shops, technical schools, and any other type of organisation that proves relevant for material reuse on a local scale.

## Stakeholder Profiles

On a second level, similarities and complementarity between agents are discussed. Profile descriptors are used to map offers and requests of each agent to the commons - for instance, tools, equipment, goods and materials. Current and desirable flows of materials and information are plotted back to the map. 

## Exchange Protocols

Finally, conversations are promoted between participants to agree on strategies and future actions. Relevant gaps in data generation and availability, legislation, communication, organisations, facilities and other aspects can guide the development of novel responses on multiple levels - from policy to technology to infrastructure. Matters such as the ownership of tools, governance of materials and the system's future evolution are decided upon collectively.

## Local incidence

Groups activated by the Reuse Commons can partner with initiatives under diverse framings such as Smart Cities, Doughnut Economy, Circular Economy and Zero Waste to design and implement protocols, policies and cooperation projects that reinforce the importance of addressing climate change at a local level. Participatory local legislation on the Right to Repair can expand national or international policy and improve the conditions for initiatives on the ground. Furthermore, technologies and collaborative methods can be used to track objects and ensure they have a longer lifetime, provide information about parts and components, and offer the means to reward individual or organisational behaviour that helps keep materials in use instead of discarding them.
