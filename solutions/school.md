# School of Reuse

## TL;DR

Preventing waste is more effective than managing it. The School of Reuse focuses on reuse education to bridge critical gaps in the circular economy.

## Introduction

Research indicates that the best way to reduce the impact of unwanted and unused materials is intervening before they are considered waste. In other words, waste prevention with the goal of reducing and reusing is generally more effective than collecting materials for recycling, incineration or landfilling. The School of Reuse will contribute with professional educational and data resources to support the reuse of materials.

Its emphasis on material reuse comes from the fact that most educational approaches to the circular economy focus chiefly on both ends of the supply chain: design and manufacturing; waste collection and recycling. There is a fundamental part missing in between consumption and waste treatment, and that is precisely the systemic reuse of goods and materials.

## What and Why?

Led by [Reuse City Studio](https://reuse.city), the School of Reuse is a collaborative initiative dedicated to filling critical gaps in resource management. By prioritizing reuse alongside recycling, the initiative addresses an often-overlooked aspect of the circular economy. While many efforts concentrate on the product lifecycle's beginning and end, the School of Reuse emphasizes the middle ground: extending a product's life through repair, repurposing, and redistribution. 

The School of Reuse provides tools and resources for teams to develop innovative reuse projects. By cultivating a skilled workforce, Reuse City Studio and its partners contribute to building a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. 

The School of Reuse fosters a collaborative atmosphere where participants learn from one another and develop innovative solutions through practical training, knowledge sharing, and community building. The initiative brings together individuals, organizations, and communities to achieve a shared objective: a world where resources are maximized and waste is minimized.
