# School of Reuse

*Project under development (August 2024).*

## Motivation

There are growing technical and legal recommendations that cities and regions must put more effort into the reuse of materials than in recycling, incineration and landfilling. However, the skills necessary for that kind of work are not being taught systematically anywhere. Successful initiatives depend on the experience and knowledge acquired by its employees on identifying what objects can or cannot be reused.

Organisations in every European country will need to adapt and invest in that sector, and there will be a need to create knowledge and train employees for the ensuing emerging roles. The School of Reuse is well positioned to offer that kind of training, based on research and prior experience.
