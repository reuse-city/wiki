# School of Reuse

## TL;DR

Research indicates that the best way to reduce the impact of unwanted and unused materials is intervening before they are considered waste. In other words, waste prevention with the goal of reducing and reusing is generally more effective than collecting materials for recycling, incineration or landfilling. The School of Reuse will contribute with professional educational and data resources to support the reuse of materials.

Its emphasis on material reuse comes from the fact that most educational approaches to the circular economy focus chiefly on both ends of the supply chain: design and manufacturing; waste collection and recycling. There is a fundamental part missing in between consumption and waste treatment, and that is precisely the systemic reuse of goods and materials.

## Motivation

There are growing technical and legal recommendations that cities and regions must put more effort into the reuse of materials than in recycling, incineration and landfilling. However, the skills necessary for that kind of work are not being taught systematically anywhere. Successful initiatives depend on the experience and knowledge acquired by its employees on identifying what objects can or cannot be reused.

Organisations in every European country will need to adapt to and invest in that sector, and there will be a need to create knowledge and train employees for the ensuing emerging roles. The School of Reuse is well positioned to offer that kind of training, based on research and prior experience.
